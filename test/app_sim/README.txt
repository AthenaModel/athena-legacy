app_sim(n) Automated Test Suite
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the automated test suite for app_sim(n).  The
entire test suite is executed by the command line

    $ minerva_test all

Individual test scripts can be executed as well.  See minerva_test(1) for
details.

At present, the test suite is minimal; tests will be added over time.
The following things should be covered by the test suite:

* Test utilities
* Simulation Orders
* Notifier Events

Note that the test suite explicitly does *NOT* cover the GUI.
