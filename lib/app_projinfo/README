Athena Projinfo Modules
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the app_projinfo(n) package, which contains
the modules of Tcl code specific to the Athena Project Info
tool, athena_projinfo(1).

NOTE: Because the modules in this package represent 
application-level code, they are generally defined as singletons
and live in the global namespace.
