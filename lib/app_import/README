Athena Version Modules
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the app(import) package, which implements
the Athena XML Import tool, athena_import(1), which is launched 
by athena(1).

NOTE: Because the modules in this package represent 
application-level code, they are generally defined as singletons
and live in the global namespace.
