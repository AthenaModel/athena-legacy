Group: Standard Method Names

Athena application modules use the following standard method names.

dbsync - Database synchronization.  This takes place when the RDB is
         changed out from under the module, and the module needs to
         resynchronize itself with the database.  This name is used
         only if the method needs to be public; most modules will
         dbsync in response to a notifier event.

init   - Module initializer; can be used by any module.  Called once 
         at application start-up.

start  - Model initializer; used by simulation modules.  It is called
         when the simulation transitions from the Scenario Preparation
         (PREP) state to the PAUSED state at time 0.

tock   - Model updater; used by simulation modules.  It is called
         during the simulation tick to advance the module's model(s) to
         the current simulation time.  (The existing modules use a
         variety of names for this purpose, including "analyze",
         "assess", and "advance".  Over time, we want to standardize on
         "tock".)
