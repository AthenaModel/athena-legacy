<a name="p1">One</a> thing was certain, that the WHITE kitten had had
nothing to do with it:--it was the black kitten's fault entirely. For
the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for
the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering);
so you see that it COULDN'T have had any hand in the mischief.<p>

<a name="p2">The</a> way Dinah washed her children's faces was this:
first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then
with the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way,
beginning at the nose: and just now, as I said, she was hard at work
on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying to
purr--no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good.<p>

<a name="p3">But</a> the black kitten had been finished with earlier
in the afternoon, and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a
corner of the great arm-chair, half talking to herself and half
asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball
of worsted Alice had been trying to wind up, and had been rolling it
up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was,
spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten
running after its own tail in the middle.<p>

<a name="p4">'Oh,</a> you wicked little thing!' cried Alice, catching
up the kitten, and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that
it was in disgrace.  'Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better
manners! You OUGHT, Dinah, you know you ought!' she added, looking
reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she
could manage--and then she scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking
the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the ball
again. But she didn't get on very fast, as she was talking all the
time, sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat
very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the
winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the
ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it might.<p>
