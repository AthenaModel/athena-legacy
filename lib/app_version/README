Athena Version Modules
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the app(version) package, which contains
the modules of Tcl code specific to the Athena Version Switcher
tool, athena_version(1), which is launched by athena(1).

NOTE: Because the modules in this package represent 
application-level code, they are generally defined as singletons
and live in the global namespace.
