Version: JNEM version identification
-----------------------------------------------------------------

libVersion is a binary Tcl extension component of the util(n) 
package.  It defines the "version" command, which returns the
current JNEM version, as set at build time.

NOTE: At present, libVersion is built into the util(n) package.
Ultimately, it will need to be specific for each delivery,
whereas util(n) will be moved to Paxsim and will be generic.
Thus, it can't stay here in the long run.
