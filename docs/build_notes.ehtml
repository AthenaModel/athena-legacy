<h2>Build Notes</h2>

<h3>Build 6.0.7, 6 December 2013</h3>

This build has some quite notable new functionality.  The second part of
the manufacturing infrastructure has been implemented.  This means that
the infrastructure now degrades with time if the new MAINTAIN tactic is not
used by an actor to keep it from going into disrepair.  Note that you can
disable the degradation of infrastructure (and thus the need to MAINTAIN it)
by not allocating any of it to actors and let the SYSTEM agent own it all.
The economic model will be impacted if the infrastructure is allowed to degrade
too far.  Cut/Copy/Paste is implemented for Blocks, Conditions and Tactics!
This means that you can cut and copy any part (or all) of one actors strategy
and paste it.  Once pasted, editing can then take place to
make possibly invalid blocks valid.<p>

<h3>Build 6.0.6, 2 December 2013</h3>

This build contains the first part of the manufacturing infrastructure model.
Manufacturing plants can be allocated to actors and neighborhoods.  The econ
model uses the capacity computed by the infrastructure model as the capacity
of the goods sector.  There's a few bug fixes and some code cleanup in a 
couple of the Mark II tactics.  The built in script editor now has better
syntax checking.<p>

<li> Bug 4243: athena(1): Manufacturing Plant Infrastructure, part I
<li> Bug 4220: Actors and System Agent share tactic lists
<li> Bug 4221: athena(1): gofer::NBHOODS not returning nbhoods properly
<li> Bug 4234: athena(1): Require tablelist 5.10

<li> Bug 4245: bean(n): clean up paste/newcopy code
<li> Bug 4236: 	athena(1): Cleanup FUND tactic tests 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.0.5, 18 November 2013</h3>

This build contains the last tactic to be converted to the Mark II Strategy
Engine: ASSIGN.  It also contains some new deployment modes for the DEPLOY 
tactic, some bug fixes to the new strategy engine and a few minor 
enhancements.<p>

<ul>

<li> Bug 4231: athena(1): Make tactic sanity check failures consistent 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.0.4, 7 November 2013</h3>

This build contains what is likely that last major update to the Mark II 
Strategy Engine.  Most of the work is complete, but there's a few loose ends
that will be tied up in later builds.  There is now a new neighborhoods 
gofer and some bug fixes as well.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4154: athena(1): update autogen to create new-style strategies.
<li> Bug 4205: athena(1): Mark II BROADCAST Tactic
<li> Bug 4212: athena(1): Mark II STANCE Tactic
<li> Bug 4191: athena(1): Mark II FLOW Tactic
<li> Bug 4206: athena(1): gofer::NBHOODS
<li> Bug 4207: athena(1): Mark II SUPPORT Tactic
<li> Bug 4214: athena(1): Remove obsolete strategy code, Part 1
<li> Bug 4216: undo causes error when referencing deleted objects
<li> Bug 4217: athena(1): Mark II DEPLOY Tactic
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.0.3, 28 October 2013</h3>

This build contains wholesale changes to the Mark II Strategy Engine that 
includes the addition of many more tactics and some changes to how some of 
the tactics are specified.  There are more robust ways of specifying how an
actor spends his money on certain tactics.  Some of the tactics have been
updated to user gofer(n) objects to retrieve list of entities from Athena
upon tactic execution.<p>

Spend as much time as is necessary to vet each of the revamped tactics. The
on-line help for all the implemented tactics should be available to aid in
testing.<p>

<h3>Build 6.0.2, 3 October 2013</h3>

This build contains the preliminary version of the Mark II Strategy Engine.
Only two conditions and a subset of the tactics have been converted to the
new engine; the remainder are unavailable in this version.<p>

The focus in this version should be on testing strategy editing, and execution
of the tactics that currently exist.  There are new Detail Browser pages, and
similar content in the Strategy/Editor tab that needs to be examined for
anomalies.  Anything that's unclear or peculiar looking should be reported.<p>

The on-line help has not yet been updated.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4147: athena(1): change the units of production in the black sector to blackBKT
<li> Bug 4148: Mark II Strategy Engine Preliminaries
<li> Bug 4153: Mark II Strategy Engine Installed
<li> Bug 4156: athena(1): Multiple item delete in Strategy/Editor
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.0.1, 25 September 2013</h3>
This build contains some enhancements to the SAM and CGE in the econ model.
Specifically, the SAM now takes remittances as a direct input and balances
the goods and pop sectors on lock by assuming any difference in total 
expenditures and total revenue in those sectors is aggregate savings (which
could be negative). The CGE now takes total geographic unemployment (GU) into
consideration when computing an equilibrium. The CGE also now has inputs
for price and wage indices for use by a future inflation model. There's also
an enhancement to how Athena produces a bgerror.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4135: athena(1): implement geographic unemployment
<li> Bug 4136: athena(1): introduce aggregate savings to balance goods and pop sectors in SAM
<li> Bug 4137: athena(1): CGE 'M' page should take into account geographic unemployment
<li> Bug 4140: athena(1): add price/wage index to CGE and econ tab
<li> Bug 4142: Update helps with new econ stuff
<li> Bug 4143: athena_test(1): test failures due to GU in the CGE
<li> Bug 4144: athena_test(1): test failures due to cell name change in CGE
<li> Bug 4145: athena(1): TACTIC:FUND:UPDATE order has wrong title
<li> Bug 4146: athena(1): provide a context stack trace on bgerror 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.0.0, 9 September 2013</h3>

This is the initial 6.0.x baseline; it is based on the same code as
Athena 5.1.0.<p>
