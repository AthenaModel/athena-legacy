<h2>Build Notes</h2>

<h3>Build 6.0.2, 3 October 2013</h3>

This build contains the preliminary version of the Mark II Strategy Engine.
Only two conditions and a subset of the tactics have been converted to the
new engine; the remainder are unavailable in this version.<p>

The focus in this version should be on testing strategy editing, and execution
of the tactics that currently exist.  There are new Detail Browser pages, and
similar content in the Strategy/Editor tab that needs to be examined for
anomalies.  Anything that's unclear or peculiar looking should be reported.<p>

The on-line help has not yet been updated.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4147: athena(1): change the units of production in the black sector to blackBKT
<li> Bug 4148: Mark II Strategy Engine Preliminaries
<li> Bug 4153: Mark II Strategy Engine Installed
<li> Bug 4156: athena(1): Multiple item delete in Strategy/Editor
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.0.1, 25 September 2013</h3>
This build contains some enhancements to the SAM and CGE in the econ model.
Specifically, the SAM now takes remittances as a direct input and balances
the goods and pop sectors on lock by assuming any difference in total 
expenditures and total revenue in those sectors is aggregate savings (which
could be negative). The CGE now takes total geographic unemployment (GU) into
consideration when computing an equilibrium. The CGE also now has inputs
for price and wage indices for use by a future inflation model. There's also
an enhancement to how Athena produces a bgerror.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 4135: athena(1): implement geographic unemployment
<li> Bug 4136: athena(1): introduce aggregate savings to balance goods and pop sectors in SAM
<li> Bug 4137: athena(1): CGE 'M' page should take into account geographic unemployment
<li> Bug 4140: athena(1): add price/wage index to CGE and econ tab
<li> Bug 4142: Update helps with new econ stuff
<li> Bug 4143: athena_test(1): test failures due to GU in the CGE
<li> Bug 4144: athena_test(1): test failures due to cell name change in CGE
<li> Bug 4145: athena(1): TACTIC:FUND:UPDATE order has wrong title
<li> Bug 4146: athena(1): provide a context stack trace on bgerror 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 6.0.0, 9 September 2013</h3>

This is the initial 6.0.x baseline; it is based on the same code as
Athena 5.1.0.<p>
