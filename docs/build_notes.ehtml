<h2>Build Notes</h2>

<h3>Build 5.0.2, 5 February 2013</h3>

There are four major areas of new functionality in this build: the 
economics model has a significant overhaul, the SPEND tactic is changed
to include a per sector spending profile (this means the overhead 
percentage is gone) and DEPOSIT and WITHDRAW tactics are added, 
the introduction of "budget" actors that don't have
an income but rather a pool of money on which to draw, and an overhaul 
to Athena's rule set infrastructure. There's also been some clean up of
unnecessary objects: actsits and demsits are gone and a host of bug fixes
and documentation updates. The full list is as follows:<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 3834: Econ/SAM help page is confusing
<li> Bug 3837: athena_sim(1): implement changing remittances over time
<li> Bug 3841: athena_sim(1): CGE updates

<li> Bug 3851: athena_sim(1): econ model not sending BaseGDP from SAM to CGE
<li> Bug 3855: athena_test(1): test failures due to econ model updates
<li> Bug 3856: athena_sim(1): econ model does not scale well
<li> Bug 3871: athena_sim(1): cannot edit SAM

</ul>

<h3>Build 5.0.1, 14 January 2013</h3>

The focus of this build is the new requirement to allow civilian 
population to flow from one group to another, with the derived
requirement that civilian groups can now be "empty", i.e., have a
population of zero.  This change leads to a number of significant
functional differences.  In a nutshell:

<ul>
<li> Civilian groups now either live by subsistence agriculture or
     they don't.  There is no SA fraction.
<li> The civilian activities DISPLACED and IN_CAMP have been removed.
     To displace members of a group, flow them into a group in another
     neighborhood.
<li> The DAM rule sets (and the rest of the models) now ignore empty groups.
<li> The new FLOW tactic is used to move population around.
</ul><p>

In addition there have been many changes to the Econ model, including
new views on the data, though this work is on-going.<p>

The full set of changes is as follows:<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 3798: Subsistence agriculture flag
<li> Bug 3804: athena_sim(1): DISPLACE tactic should no longer allow specifying a neighborhood
<li> Bug 3805: athena_sim(1): change cell model file name from eco6x6 to cge6x6
<li> Bug 3806: athena_sim(1): include calculation of Base GDP in SAM sheet
<li> Bug 3807: athena(1): Civilian groups can have a basepop of 0
<li> Bug 3808: athena(1): ENI Service and Empty Civilian Groups
<li> Bug 3809: athena(1): [demog analyze econ] bgerror's on empty group.
<li> Bug 3811: athena_sim(1): have econ model output the cmsnap(5) format rather than just a dump of cells when an error occurs
<li> Bug 3812: athena(1): Empty groups and ensits, actsits, CONTROL, MOOD, IOMs, and MADs
<li> Bug 3813: athena(1): Attrition and Empty Civilian Groups
<li> Bug 3814: athena(1): Empty Groups and appserver pages
<li> Bug 3817: athena_sim(1): refactor Econ/SAM tab
<li> Bug 3818: athena_test fails when TCLLIBPATH doesn't exist
<li> Bug 3819: Empty civilian groups and security
<li> Bug 3820: athena_sim(1): updated CGE cell model
<li> Bug 3821: Remove DISPLACED and IN_CAMPS activities
<li> Bug 3822: Remove unit-based displacement from the Demographics Model
<li> Bug 3823: athena_sim(1): strategy initialization must take place before econ initialization when locking
<li> Bug 3824: Demographics tables are initialized during PREP
<li> Bug 3825: athena_sim(1): FUNDENI tactic fails to refund money correctly when trying to fund empty groups
<li> Bug 3826: Demog allows population adjustments
<li> Bug 3827: athena_sim(1): Add new views for T matrix and X+T matrix to Econ/SAM tab
<li> Bug 3828: FLOW Tactic: Data Editing
<li> Bug 3829: FLOW Tactic: Execution
<li> Bug 3830: Simplified Driver Signatures
</ul>

<h3>Build 5.0.0, 10 December 2012</h3>

This is the initial 5.0.x baseline; it is based on the same code as
Athena 4.1.0.<p>
