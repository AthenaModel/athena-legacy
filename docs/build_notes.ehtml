<h2>Build Notes</h2>

<h3>Build 3.1.1, 15 March 2012</h3>

This build contains a couple of minor documentation fixes, and a new
feature required by Rob Crowson: Athena now accumulates more history
data than it previously did.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 3338: AAG header says "Athena User's Guide"
  <li> Bug 3340: install.txt is out of date
  <li> Bug 3343: History: Control, Support, Influence, Security and Volatility
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 3.1.0, 28 February 2012</h3>

This is the first Athena 3.1 release candidate, and (unless
significant problems are found with it) the release build itself.  It
contains no significant changes, except that it targets release rather
than development, and the documents are delivered as PDF files instead
of MS Word files.<p>
