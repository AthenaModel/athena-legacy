<h3>Build 1.0.12, 27 July 2009</h3>

This build contains mostly bug fixes and a number of new
user-requested reports.  The reports include the Drivers Report, which
lists the events and situations which are driving attitude change; the
Civilian and Organization Satisfaction reports and the Cooperation
report, which show the current attitude levels with deltas from time
0; and the "Contributions to Satisfaction" report, which is Athena's
version of the JNEM "Satisfaction Curve" report.  Unlike that report,
it is capable of showing contributions to a neighborhood group's mood
as well as to its individual satisfaction curves.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2199: athena_sim(1): Drivers Report
  <li> Bug 2200: athena_sim(1): Report Browser doesn't jump to most recent report

  <li> Bug 2209: athena_sim(1): PREP-only orders not disabled at start-up
  <li> Bug 2210: athena_sim(1): Contributions to Satisfaction Report 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 1.0.11, 20 July 2009</h3>

This build fixes a number of bugs found by Rob Crowson and Chris
Kocmoud during their recent visit; in addition, it completes the
initial implementation of the Athena Attrition Model.  In particular,
the effects of attrition on civilian and organization attitudes are
now documented in docs/dev/rules.odt and carried out by the
application, and "normal" attrition now takes place (assuming that
the attacking ROEs are set up, and the other stats are favorable).
See docs/dev/aag_AAM.odt for details.  There's also a spreadsheet,
docs/dev/NFvsUF.odt, that contains the NF vs. UF attrition model, for
comparison with the actual results.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2188: athena_sim(1): Activity Parameter Errors
  <li> Bug 2189: browser_base(sim): Pencil icon remains enabled when selection is hidden
  <li> Bug 2190: rules.doc: FUELSHRT in Ensit summary table
  <li> Bug 2194: athena_sim(1): Retain attrition statistics
  <li> Bug 2195: Athena 'rules.odt' document is missing from 'eis/athena'
  <li> Bug 2196: athena_sim(1): CIVCAS/ORGCAS Assessment
  <li> Bug 2197: athena_sim(1): UF vs NF attrition
  <li> Bug 2198: athena_sim(1): NF vs UF Attrition 
</ul>


<h3>Build 1.0.10, 13 July 2009</h3>

This build contains the initial implementation of Magic Attrition,
which allows units and civilian groups to be attrited, but does not
assess the attitude implications.  It also adds Rules of Engagement
entities as a first step toward implementing the normal attrition
model.  Finally, it adds a built-in help browser, with a smattering of
help pages; much remains to be written here.  Plus there are some bug
fixes.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2162: athena_sim(1): ada(sim) becomes dam(sim)
  <li> Bug 2163: parmdb(5): activity.*.assignedToActive is now activity.*.shifts
  <li> Bug 2164: athena_sim(1): Magic Attrition
  <li> Bug 2168: Athena Rules Document is missing
  <li> Bug 2169: Update Athena to ATEE 2009Q2
  <li> Bug 2170: athena_sim(1): Rules of Engagement
  <li> Bug 2176: help(5), plus tools
  <li> Bug 2179: helptool(1): "enumdoc" macro
  <li> Bug 2185: athena_sim(1): Save snapshots in Tcl format
  <li> Bug 2186: athena_sim(1): Don't include GRAM history in snapshots 
</ul>

<h3>Build 1.0.9, 24 June 2009</h3>

This build contains the initial version of the Athena Demographics
Model (DEMOG).  It tracks population changes due to civilian unit
placement.  In principle it also tracks the effects of civilian
attrition, though there are no sources of attrition in this build.  In
addition, there are a bunch of bug fixes.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2150: athena_sim(1): Demographic model
  <li> Bug 2153: athena_sim(1): REFUGEE is now DISPLACED
  <li> Bug 2155: scenariodb(n): concerns, activity, activity_gtype redefinition
  <li> Bug 2156: Create ensit dialog allows location outside all neighborhoods
  <li> Bug 2157: Entering locations 'manually' fails to handle caps/no caps
  <li> Bug 2158: "Update Situation" on ensit pop-up is grayed-out at wrong time
  <li> Bug 2159: bgerror: invalid command name "" 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 1.0.8, 22 June 2009</h3>

This build contains a variety of changes.  There are better error
messages in many of the order dialogs; neighborhoods can be colored
according to mood; civilian units are now allowed, and the civilian
unit orders have been revised; force groups can be uniformed
vs. non-uniformed; and the set of ensits has changed.  In addition, a
number of bugs have been fixed.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2050: Can't open scenario, database source already in use
  <li> Bug 2058: 'Clear defaults' confirmation needs an additional notice
  <li> Bug 2067: Expand range error messages in dialogs
  <li> Bug 2122: athena_sim(1): Order dialog errors aren't cleared on success
  <li> Bug 2128: athena_sim(1): Color nbhoods according to mood
  <li> Bug 2133: athena_sim(1): Display nbhood mood in Neighborhoods tab
  <li> Bug 2134: athena_sim(1): Allow civilian units
  <li> Bug 2136: athena_sim(1): Envsit order changes
  <li> Bug 2137: athena_sim(1): Sim reconfigured twice on "snapshot load"

  <li> Bug 2151: athena_sim(1): Redesign of UNIT orders
  <li> Bug 2152: athena_sim(1): Ensit Changes
</ul>

<h3>Build 1.0.7, 27 May 2009</h3>

This build includes many significant changes.  Athena now analyzes the
population and units within a neighborhood, and creates activity
situations; in addition, the analyst can create and resolve
environmental situations.  A new flock of Athena Driver Assessment
(ADA) rule sets assess the GRAM implications of these situations.
Rule firings are reported on the new Report Browser tab.  There are
also a number of GUI enhancements.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2040: nbstat(sim): Neighborhood statistics
  <li> Bug 2052: Run 'sanity check' failure should first bring the log browser forward
  <li> Bug 2055: athena_sim(1): Hierarchical Tabs
  <li> Bug 2062: Activity Situations
  <li> Bug 2065: athena_sim(1): Creating new force groups is *slow*
  <li> Bug 2066: athena_sim(1): profile command
  <li> Bug 2068: athena_sim(1): Do first tick quicker!

  <li> Bug 2119: athena_sim(1): Force activity situation rule sets
  <li> Bug 2120: athena_sim(1): ORG activity rule sets
  <li> Bug 2121: athena_sim(1): Environmental Situation Rule Sets 
</ul>

<h3>Build 1.0.6, 13 April 2009</h3>

This build includes significant new changes.  For the first time it's
possible to run simulated time forward.  By using the "Sat" browser
it's possible to watch satisfaction levels change as time advances.
Note that the levels will only change if the long-term trend is
non-zero.  In addition, Athena takes a snapshot of simulation state
whenever time begins to advance; and the user can step back through
the snapshots.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 1964: athena_sim(1): CLI command history is not being saved
  <li> Bug 1965: athena_sim(1): Undo information should be cleared at each tick.
  <li> Bug 1966: sim(sim): Notifier Event Cleanup
  <li> Bug 1967: athena_sim(1): Scenario Sanity Check
  <li> Bug 1968: athena_sim(1): Bug when opening invalid scenario
  <li> Bug 1969: athena_sim(1): Snapshot Navigation and the Snapshot State
  <li> Bug 1972: athena_sim(1): Integrate gram(n)
  <li> Bug 1973: athena_sim(1): Jumping to snapshot 0 goes straight to PREP
  <li> Bug 1977: athena_sim(1): Command-line Executive
  <li> Bug 1979: athena_sim(1): Model parameter database
  <li> Bug 1982: bgerror creating NB Group: can't read "values": no such variable
  <li> Bug 1988: athena_sim(1): Display GRAM outputs
  <li> Bug 1989: bgerror: can't find package pixane
  <li> Bug 1991: athena_sim(1): Update all browsers to use base_browser(sim)
  <li> Bug 1994: prefs(5): Athena User Preferences
  <li> Bug 1996: scenariodb(n) delegates -clock to sqldocument(n)
  <li> Bug 2033: athena_sim(1): Save CLI history to ~/.athena/history.cli
  <li> Bug 2037: athena_sim(1): nbstat(sim) inputs
  <li> Bug 2038: athena_sim(1): gram_ng is incorrectly populated 
</ul><p>


<h3>Build 1.0.5, 26 March 2009</h3>

This build contains a host of bug fixes, and four significant additions.
First, athena_sim(1) is now truly a simulation: simulated time can
elapse.  The user can run forward, pause, run forward, pause, and
return to time 0.  Second, the simulation automatically takes snapshots of
simulation state whenever time starts to advance, and when
restarting.  Returning to time 0 uses one of this snapshots; as yet,
there's no GUI to access the others.  Third, as the simulation mode
changes from PREP to RUNNING to PAUSED, the various orders are appropriately
enabled and disabled.  For example, you can't create or delete groups
or neighborhoods except in PREP mode.  Fourth, as orders are enabled
and disabled, the GUI controls which send the orders or popup their
dialogs are also enabled and disabled.  This last capability is of
great generality, capable of checking any arbitrary conditions that
determine whether a menu item, button, or other widget is enabled or
disabled.<p>

The complete set of packages is as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 1929: Correct inconsistent labeling for foreign/local FRC groups
  <li> Bug 1930: Delete neighborhood from menu doesn't enable buttons
  <li> Bug 1931: Change the map drawing icon for Units to a 'U' in a box
  <li> Bug 1934: bgerror: Error in constructor: can't read "newval": no such variable
  <li> Bug 1938: Nbhood fill doesn't affect new neighborhoods
  <li> Bug 1939: Unit background defaults to black
  <li> Bug 1941: Lighten the blank map
  <li> Bug 1942: ORG Group dialogs are not auto-filled when an ORG group is clicked
  <li> Bug 1943: Discarding changes fails to fill in 'Update' dialog as expected
  <li> Bug 1944: Wrong entry field selected in 'Update Mult Nbhood Relationships'
  <li> Bug 1949: Maps at different zoom levels confuse athena_sim's map display
  <li> Bug 1950: athena_sim(1): Unit Icons
  <li> Bug 1951: athena_sim(1): Remove organization capability flags
  <li> Bug 1958: athena_sim(1): Simulation!
  <li> Bug 1961: athena_sim(1): auto-snapshot capability
  <li> Bug 1962: athena_sim(1): Order states
  <li> Bug 1963: athena_sim(1): State-based GUI control
</ul><p>


<h3>Build 1.0.4, 3 March 2009</h3>

This build includes a redesign of the Athena order processor and
order entry GUI.  It also adds force and organization units, and
the ability to export and import Athena scenarios as XML.  The
full list of changes is as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 1846: Map scale indicator incorrect on loading scenario
  <li> Bug 1888: Order Dialog geometry management failure
  <li> Bug 1908: athena_sim(1): The Great Order Redesign
  <li> Bug 1916: Delete from entity browser should bypass order dialog
  <li> Bug 1922: athlib(n)/athgui(n) become projectlib(n), projectgui(n)
  <li> Bug 1923: athena_sim(1): Force and Organization Units
  <li> Bug 1924: orderdialog(sim): First Key Field has no valid values
  <li> Bug 1925: athena_export(1), athena_import(1): XML export and import 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 1.0.3, 11 February 2009</h3>

This build includes auto-population and user editing of group
relationships, cooperation levels, and neighborhood relationships (i.e.,
proximity).  In addition, it's now possible to edit multiple entities
at a time from any of the entity browsers.  Finally, the architecture
used to support auto-population of dependent entities and the
architecture of the athena_sim(1) test suite have both been
extensively overhauled.  See the following packages for details:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 1884: Multi-Update Orders
  <li> Bug 1890: athena_sim(1): Manage group relationships
  <li> Bug 1904: athena_sim(1): Manage cooperation levels
  <li> Bug 1905: athena_sim(1): scenario reconciliation
  <li> Bug 1907: athena_sim(1): Manage neighborhood relationships 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 1.0.2, 27 January 2009</h3>

This build includes some new features, plus a number of usability
enhancements.  Civilian and organization satisfaction curves are now
created and deleted automatically as their parent entities are
created and deleted.  There's a new "Sat" browser for the satisfaction
curves.  The Log tab now includes a log list, so that the user can
view each of the logs for the current session.  The entity browsers
now support incremental, case-insensitive filtering by default.  And
the order dialog's handling of invalid key combinations is much
improved.  See the following packages for details.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 1868: Data loss caused by moving the "Create Neighborhood" dialog box
  <li> Bug 1869: athena_sim(1): Add loglist to Log tab
  <li> Bug 1870: athena_sim(1): Widen component column in loglist
  <li> Bug 1872: athena_sim(1): Civilian Satisfaction Curves
  <li> Bug 1873: cif(sim): dump
  <li> Bug 1877: tablebrowser(n): incremental, case-insensitive filtering
  <li> Bug 1878: athena_sim(1): Preventing database corruption on order send, undo
  <li> Bug 1879: Order dialog and non-existent entities
  <li> Bug 1880: Dialog text needs update for deleting a Neighborhood Group
  <li> Bug 1881: Dialog offers invalid choices, then complains when one is selected
  <li> Bug 1882: Manage ORG satisfaction levels
  <li> Bug 1883: Order dialog key parameters 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 1.0.1, 16 January 2009</h3>

  <li> Bug 1863: Undo of entity deletion
  <li> Bug 1864: athena_test(1) stack traces on unknown test script 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 1.0.0, 9 January 2009</h3>

This is the first official build of Athena.  It includes the initial
version of <<xref athena_sim(1)>>, which is capable of:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Creating, saving, and opening a scenario document.
  <li> Importing a map image.
