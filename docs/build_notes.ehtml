<h2>Build Notes</h2>

<h3>Build 4.0.2, 30 April 2012</h3>

This is the second Athena 4 build.  It contains a number of bug fixes,
including two significant bugs involving display of civilian groups, and the
rest of the work required to make Athena use horizontal and vertical 
relationships from URAM.  It includes one of the vertical relationship
rule sets, the new MOOD rule set; the remaining two vrel rule sets will
be added as rule subsets to the existing ENI and CONTROL rule sets in
Athena 4.0.3.  The specific bugs in this build are as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug: 3346 History Parameters not in Model Parameters Tree
  <li> Bug: 3389 athena(1): gui_civgroups fails after reload
  <li> Bug: 3390 athena(1): Ensit spawn and ensit auto-resolve

<h3>Build 4.0.1, 24 April 2012</h3>

This is the first Athena 4 build; it contains many changes since
Athena 3.1 was branched from the trunk.  The most significant are that
the tick size is now seven days; that strategies can be used to set up
initial conditions by tagging tactics with the "on lock" flag; and
that GRAM has been replaced with URAM (although URAM integration is
not yet complete; see Bug 3386).  The specific bugs are as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 3337: CM Plan: Release procedure
  <li> Bug 3339: AAG header says "Athena User's Guide"
  <li> Bug 3341: install.txt is out of date
  <li> Bug 3344: athena_sim(1): Add 6x6 economic model to trunk
  <li> Bug 3355: athena(1): Effects Delay
  <li> Bug 3358: athena_sim(1): ENI changes
  <li> Bug 3365: athena_sim(1): Remove status quo funding from ENI
  <li> Bug 3371: athena(1): Introduce "on lock" flag for all tactics.
  <li> Bug 3372: athena(1): Detail browser needs to display saturation/required levels of ENI funding for each CIV group when in PREP
  <li> Bug 3375: athena_test(1): automated test suite errors
  <li> Bug 3381: athena_sim(1): Change default tick size to 1 week.
  <li> Bug 3382: athena_sim(1): Remove trends, thresholds and the "set" capabilities from athena
  <li> Bug 3386: athena(1): URAM Integration
</ul>
