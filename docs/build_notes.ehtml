<h3>Build 3.0.3, 2 November 2010</h3>

<h3>Build 3.0.2, 25 October 2010</h3>

This build contains a number of minor bug fixes, and two significant
changes.  First, Athena now supports scripting of simulation orders.
A script can send orders, and the complete order history can be saved
as a script.  In aid of this, the longer order names have been
considerably shortened; the SITUATION:ENVIRONMENTAL:* orders, for
example, are now the ENSIT:* orders.<p>

Second, the model architecture has been significantly changed: each
civilian group now resides in exactly one neighborhood.  There is no
longer a distinction between toplevel civilian groups and neighborhood
groups.  Groups that would have been neighborhood groups of the same
toplevel group are now modeled as civilian groups with a strong
positive relationship.<p>

The full list of packages is as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2610: More Online Help Glossary Typos
  <li> Bug 2613: athena_sim(1): In NBHOOD:UPDATE:*, vtygain changes are not undone.
  <li> Bug 2621: athena_sim(1): Each civ group resides in one neighborhood
  <li> Bug 2622: Update Scheduled Activity Bgerror
  <li> Bug 2624: EnSit Info Appears on Terminal Window
  <li> Bug 2625: athena_sim(1): Order renaming

  <li> Bug 2631: athena_sim(1): Execute on OS X
  <li> Bug 2633: athena_sim(1): Integrate gram2 into Athena 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 3.0.1, 11 October 2010</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2611: Order Dialog Overhaul

</ul><p>
