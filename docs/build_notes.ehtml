<h2>Build Notes</h2>

<h3>Build 3.0.6, 4 January 2011</h3>

This build begins the integration of the Mars Affinity Model into
Athena: mam(n) is initialized, and mam(n) entities are created for
each civilian group and actor.  In addition, this build makes use of
SQLite3's support for foreign keys and cascading deletes to greatly
simplify the scenario-editing code.  Finally, FRC and ORG groups now
have owning actors.  The full set of changes is as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2734: athena_sim(1): mam(n) Integration, actor and CIV group editing
  <li> Bug 2735: athena_sim(1); Sat curves created and deleted with CIV groups
  <li> Bug 2736: athena_sim(1): bgerror on SIM:UNLOCK
  <li> Bug 2737: athena_sim(1): Delete "::nbrel reconcile"
  <li> Bug 2739: athena_sim(1): Delete "::civgroup mutate reconcile"
  <li> Bug 2740: athena_sim(1): Delete "::coop mutate reconcile"
  <li> Bug 2741: athena_sim(1): Delete "::personnel mutate reconcile"
  <li> Bug 2742: athena_sim(1): Delete "::attroe mutate reconcile"
  <li> Bug 2743: athena_sim(1): Delete "::defroe mutate reconcile"
  <li> Bug 2744: athena_sim(1): Snapshots cannot contain NULLs
  <li> Bug 2745: athena_sim(1): Delete "::activity mutate reconcile"
  <li> Bug 2746: athena_sim(1): Notes on removing "ensit mutate reconcile"
  <li> Bug 2748: athena_sim(1): FRC and ORG groups have owning actors 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 3.0.5, 20 December 2010</h3>

The bulk of the changes in this build involve streamlining some of the
low-level data handling in Athena.  In particular, Athena modules are
no longer responsible for sending out <Entity> events when entities
(e.g., neighborhoods or groups) change in some way; instead, given
that the relevant changes are all in the RDB, RDB triggers are used to
do automatic row monitoring.<p>

In addition, this build contains the first occurrence of actors in
Athena.  At present, Actors can be created, updated, and modified, but
they don't actually do anything.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2721: athena_sim(1): Undo cleanup
  <li> Bug 2722: scenariodb(n): Include mam(n) schema
  <li> Bug 2723: athena_sim(1): Automatic row monitoring
  <li> Bug 2726: athena_sim(1): Automatic row monitoring, part II
  <li> Bug 2729: athena_sim(1): longnames no longer require uniqueness
  <li> Bug 2730: athena_sim(1): Actors 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 3.0.4, 17 November 2010</h3>

This package fixes a number of bugs found in the last couple of weeks,
but no new functionality; all current development work has been on
gram2(n).<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2660: Plot Tab Bgerror
  <li> Bug 2661: athena_sim(1): Remove "HERE" rows from nbrel(sim)/nbrelbrowser(sim)
  <li> Bug 2669: Bgerror while sorting econ browser columns
  <li> Bug 2677: athena_sim(1): Can create groups called "CIV", "FRC", and "ORG"
  <li> Bug 2679: Open New Scenario Plot Bgerror
  <li> Bug 2684: In Camp Civilians Going to Wrong Nbhood
  <li> Bug 2688: athena_test(1): Update for Bug 2687 
</ul>

<h3>Build 3.0.3, 2 November 2010</h3>

This build contains a number of user interface improvements.
In particular, editing group colors is streamlined.  The full
set of changes is as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2306: Constrain unit colors to a small set
  <li> Bug 2622: Update Scheduled Activity Bgerror
  <li> Bug 2636: athena_sim(1): Update to display variables
  <li> Bug 2637: athena_sim(1): Default values and range fields
  <li> Bug 2640: athena_sim(1): Remove force group "coalition" flag
  <li> Bug 2643: athena_sim(1): dump coop/sat level/slope commands
  <li> Bug 2648: Update Athena to ATEE 2010Q3
  <li> Bug 2653: athena_sim(1): "send" executive command pops up GUI confirmation
  <li> Bug 2655: athena_sim(1): Default sim speed is 10 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 3.0.2, 25 October 2010</h3>

This build contains a number of minor bug fixes, and two significant
changes.  First, Athena now supports scripting of simulation orders.
A script can send orders, and the complete order history can be saved
as a script.  In aid of this, the longer order names have been
considerably shortened; the SITUATION:ENVIRONMENTAL:* orders, for
example, are now the ENSIT:* orders.<p>

Second, the model architecture has been significantly changed: each
civilian group now resides in exactly one neighborhood.  There is no
longer a distinction between toplevel civilian groups and neighborhood
groups.  Groups that would have been neighborhood groups of the same
toplevel group are now modeled as civilian groups with a strong
positive relationship.<p>

The full list of packages is as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2610: More Online Help Glossary Typos
  <li> Bug 2613: athena_sim(1): In NBHOOD:UPDATE:*, vtygain changes are not undone.
  <li> Bug 2621: athena_sim(1): Each civ group resides in one neighborhood
  <li> Bug 2622: Update Scheduled Activity Bgerror
  <li> Bug 2624: EnSit Info Appears on Terminal Window
  <li> Bug 2625: athena_sim(1): Order renaming
  <li> Bug 2626: athena_sim(1): "send" executive command
  <li> Bug 2630: athena_sim(1): "export" command
  <li> Bug 2631: athena_sim(1): Execute on OS X
  <li> Bug 2633: athena_sim(1): Integrate gram2 into Athena 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 3.0.1, 11 October 2010</h3>

This build contains a major overhaul of Athena's order dialog
infrastructure.  The packages are as follows:<p>


<ul>
  <li> Bug 2611: Order Dialog Overhaul
  <li> Bug 2614: athena_sim(1): Prepare for GRAM changes 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 3.0.0, 29 September 2010 -- Baseline Build</h3>

This build is the 3.0.0 baseline build; it is identical to
Athena 2.1.0, except for the version number.<p>
