<h2>Build Notes</h2>

<h3>Build 2.1.2, 10 November 2010</h3>

This build corrects two problems.  First, clicking on the column headers
in the Econ/Capacity browser could cause a bgerror; second, creating
a new scenario with plots open in the Plots tab could also cause
a bgerror.  The specific packages are as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2668: Bgerror while sorting econ browser columns
  <li> Bug 2671: Plot Tab Bgerror 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 2.1.1, 2 November 2010</h3>

This build corrects two problems.  First, the Analyst's Guide and
Rules documents were delivered only in OpenOffice format; now they are
also included as PDF files.<p>

Second, the Economic model mishandled the
accounting for workers who stay home from their jobs in fear for their
lives.  Such workers were treated as having left the work force
altogether, which caused unemployment to be understated.  The current
version treats such workers as having quit their jobs, and hence as
being unemployed.  This tends to overstate unemployment, but is far
preferable.  It may be wise to increase the values of the
econ.secFactor.label.* model parameters so that the effect of low
security isn't quite so drastic.<p>

The complete list of changes is as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2658: athena_sim(1): Unemployment affected by LSF
  <li> Bug 2659: PDF Documentation 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 2.1.0, 29 September 2010</h3>

This build is the the first Athena 2.1 release candidate, and (unless
significant problems are found with it) also the release build.  It
contains no changes except for those involved in marking it as
Athena 2.1.<p>
