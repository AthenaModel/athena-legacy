<h2>Build Notes</h2>

<h3>Build 5.0.1, 14 January 2013</h3>

The focus of this build is the new requirement to allow civilian 
population to flow from one group to another, with the derived
requirement that civilian groups can now be "empty", i.e., have a
population of zero.  This change leads to a number of significant
functional differences.  In a nutshell:

<ul>
<li> Civilian groups now either live by subsistence agriculture or
     they don't.  There is no SA fraction.
<li> The civilian activities DISPLACED and IN_CAMP have been removed.
     To displace members of a group, flow them into a group in another
     neighborhood.
<li> The DAM rule sets (and the rest of the models) now ignore empty groups.
<li> The new FLOW tactic is used to move population around.
</ul><p>

In addition there have been many changes to the Econ model, including
new views on the data, though this work is on-going.<p>

The full set of changes is as follows:<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 3798: Subsistence agriculture flag
<li> Bug 3804: athena_sim(1): DISPLACE tactic should no longer allow specifying a neighborhood
<li> Bug 3805: athena_sim(1): change cell model file name from eco6x6 to cge6x6
<li> Bug 3806: athena_sim(1): include calculation of Base GDP in SAM sheet

<li> Bug 3808: athena(1): ENI Service and Empty Civilian Groups
<li> Bug 3809: athena(1): [demog analyze econ] bgerror's on empty group.
<li> Bug 3811: athena_sim(1): have econ model output the cmsnap(5) format rather than just a dump of cells when an error occurs
<li> Bug 3812: athena(1): Empty groups and ensits, actsits, CONTROL, MOOD, IOMs, and MADs
<li> Bug 3813: athena(1): Attrition and Empty Civilian Groups

<li> Bug 3821: Remove DISPLACED and IN_CAMPS activities
<li> Bug 3822: Remove unit-based displacement from the Demographics Model
<li> Bug 3823: athena_sim(1): strategy initialization must take place before econ initialization when locking

<li> Bug 3828: FLOW Tactic: Data Editing
<li> Bug 3829: FLOW Tactic: Execution
<li> Bug 3830: Simplified Driver Signatures
</ul>
