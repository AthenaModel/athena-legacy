<h2>Build Notes</h2>

<h3>Build 1.0.3, 11 February 2009</h3>

This build includes auto-population and user editing of group
relationships, cooperation levels, and neighborhood relationships (i.e.,
proximity).  In addition, it's now possible to edit multiple entities
at a time from any of the entity browsers.  Finally, the architecture
used to support auto-population of dependent entities and the
architecture of the athena_sim(1) test suite have both been
extensively overhauled.  See the following packages for details:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 1884: Multi-Update Orders
  <li> Bug 1890: athena_sim(1): Manage group relationships
  <li> Bug 1904: athena_sim(1): Manage cooperation levels
  <li> Bug 1905: athena_sim(1): scenario reconciliation
  <li> Bug 1907: athena_sim(1): Manage neighborhood relationships 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 1.0.2, 27 January 2009</h3>

This build includes some new features, plus a number of usability
enhancements.  Civilian and organization satisfaction curves are now
created and deleted automatically as their parent entities are
created and deleted.  There's a new "Sat" browser for the satisfaction
curves.  The Log tab now includes a log list, so that the user can
view each of the logs for the current session.  The entity browsers
now support incremental, case-insensitive filtering by default.  And
the order dialog's handling of invalid key combinations is much
improved.  See the following packages for details.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 1868: Data loss caused by moving the "Create Neighborhood" dialog box
  <li> Bug 1869: athena_sim(1): Add loglist to Log tab
  <li> Bug 1870: athena_sim(1): Widen component column in loglist
  <li> Bug 1872: athena_sim(1): Civilian Satisfaction Curves
  <li> Bug 1873: cif(sim): dump
  <li> Bug 1877: tablebrowser(n): incremental, case-insensitive filtering
  <li> Bug 1878: athena_sim(1): Preventing database corruption on order send, undo
  <li> Bug 1879: Order dialog and non-existent entities
  <li> Bug 1880: Dialog text needs update for deleting a Neighborhood Group
  <li> Bug 1881: Dialog offers invalid choices, then complains when one is selected
  <li> Bug 1882: Manage ORG satisfaction levels
  <li> Bug 1883: Order dialog key parameters 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 1.0.0, 9 January 2009</h3>

This is the first official build of Athena.  It includes the initial
version of <<xref athena_sim(1)>>, which is capable of:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Creating, saving, and opening a scenario document.
  <li> Importing a map image.
  <li> Creating neighborhoods and force groups.
</ul>

There are no Bugzilla packages to list; bug tracking begins with this
