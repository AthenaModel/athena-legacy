<h2>Build Notes</h2>

<h3>Build 3.0.26, 29 August 2011</h3>

<b>Note:</b> Like previous builds, this one contains database schema
incompatibilties.  To bring scenario data forward from 3.0.23 or
later, following the migration procedure listed under Build 3.0.24,
below.  (The instructions regarding BSYSTEM:BELIEF:UPDATE only apply
for Athena 3.0.23 scenarios.).<p>

This build contains a number of significant enhancements.  First, it
completes the Essential Non-Infrastructure (ENI) services model with a
satisfaction rule set and proper reporting in the Detail Browser.
Second, it defines a new tactic, EXECUTIVE, which executes an Athena
executive command (aka a CLI command).  Because that command can
execute an entire script, this greatly increases the scope of tactic
execution.  A number of executive commands have been added or extended
to support this tactic: "call", "log", "sigevent", "ensit",
"last_mad".  Many of the ATTRIT:*, MAD:*, and ENSIT:* orders can now
be sent or scheduled by this new tactic.<p>

The complete list of packages is as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 3115: athena(1): ENI rule set
  <li> Bug 3120: athena(1): ENI Appserver Changes
  <li> Bug 3121: athena(1): Magic Set/Adjust labels are incorrect
  <li> Bug 3128: athena(1): call, log, sigevent executive commands
  <li> Bug 3129: athena(1): EXECUTIVE tactic
  <li> Bug 3131: athena(1): "TACTIC" order state
  <li> Bug 3132: athena(1): Schedule attrition orders in EXECUTIVE tactic
  <li> Bug 3133: athena(1): Use magic input orders with EXECUTIVE tactic
  <li> Bug 3134: athena(1): Use ensit orders with the EXECUTIVE
       tactic.
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 3.0.25, 17 August 2011</h3>

This build fixes two minor problems found in the new features of Build
3.0.24.  See the notes on Build 3.0.24 for details on the significant
changes since Build 3.0.23, including a procedure for migrating
scenarios from Build 3.0.23 to Build 3.0.24/25.  The changes in this
build are as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 3110: 0value Bgerror
  <li> Bug 3111: opts(-batch): no such variable bgerror
</ul><p>


<h3>Build 3.0.24, 16 August 2011</h3>

This build includes several major changes, including significant
database schema changes.  It includes the initial implementation of
the Essential Non-Infrastructure (ENI) Services model, and also some
scenario changes.<p>

<b>Batch Mode:</b>  Athena now supports batch-mode execution.  See the
<<xref athena(1)>> man page for details.<p>

<b>Scenario Changes:</b> Builds prior to Athena 3.0.24 had a
chicken-and-egg problem at time 0, when the scenario is locked: they
expected to execute actors' stragies to initialize the state of affairs at
time 0.  The difficulty is that strategies are executed in the context
of the current state of affairs, and things go awry if there isn't
one.  Thus, Build 3.0.24 includes two significant changes to provide
the status quo state-of-affairs:<p>

<ol>
  <li> Status quo troop deployments: a whole host of variables that
       affect how strategies execute depend on the deployment of force
       and organization groups to neighborhoods--but deployments are
       determined by the DEPLOY tactic.  Consequently, we need another
       way to indicate the "status quo" deployment, i.e., the
       deployments prior to the first strategy execution at time 0.
       Enter these troops deployments explicitly on the
       Groups/Deployments tab, prior to locking the scenario.  <b>If
       no status quo deployments are created, Athena will assume that
       there were no force or organization group personnel in the
       playbox prior to time 0.</b><p>

  <li> Status quo ENI funding. Actors provide Essential
       Non-Infrastructure (ENI) Services to the civilian groups via
       the FUNDENI tactic.  As with deployments, the level of ENI
       funding is determined during strategy execution, but how the
       stragies execute depends on the previous level of ENI funding.
       Consequently, the status quo level of ENI funding of each
       civilian group by each actor needs to be set explicitly on the
       Groups/Services tab.  <b>If no status quo funding levels are
       set, Athena will assume that no services were being provided
       prior to time 0.  This will likely cause vertical relationships
       to be wrong.</b>
</ol>

<b>Migration Procedure:</b> Use the following procedure to migrate
Athena 3.0.23 scenario files to Athena 3.0.24.<p> 

<ol>
  <li> Open the scenario file in Athena 3.0.23.<p>
       
  <li> If the scenario is locked, unlock it.  Locked scenarios cannot
       be migrated.<p>
       
  <li> Select View/Command Line from the menu bar, to make the Athena
       command line appear.<p>

  <li> At the command line, enter<p>

       <pre>&gt; export myscenario.tcl</pre>  <p>

  <li> Open myscenario.tcl in a text editor, and update all instances
       of the BSYSTEM:BELIEF:UPDATE order.  In particular:<p>

       <ul>
         <li> Change the <code>-tolerance</code> option to the
              <code>-emphasis</code> option.
         <li> Update the option's value as well:
              <ul>
                <li> VT -&gt; ASTRONG
                <li> T  -&gt; AWEAK
                <li> B  -&gt; NEITHER
                <li> I  -&gt; DWEAK
                <li> VI -&gt; DSTRONG
                <li> EI -&gt; DEXTREME
              </ul>
       </ul><p>

       Alternatively, delete all BSYSTEM:BELIEF:UPDATE orders, and
       re-enter the belief system from scratch.<p>

  <li> Invoke Athena 3.0.24, and make the command line visible, as
       above.  At the command line, enter:<p>

       <pre>&gt; call myscenario.tcl</pre>

  <li> Save the resulting scenario.<p>
       
</ol><p>


The complete set of changes is as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 3065: Update Goal is Met Condition Bgerror
  <li> Bug 3067: athena(1): Essential (Non-Infrastructure) Services
  <li> Bug 3082: athena(1): Status quo deployments
  <li> Bug 3083: athena(1): Empty force units
  <li> Bug 3084: athena(1): Status quo deployments, appserver pages
  <li> Bug 3085: athena(1): ENI Services, V.ga effects.
  <li> Bug 3098: athena(1): Save CLI history for previous session
  <li> Bug 3103: athena(1): Replace "tolerance" with "emphasis" in belief systems
  <li> Bug 3108: athena(1): Batch Mode Changes 
</ul><p>


<h3>Build 3.0.23, 18 July 2011</h3>

are now displayed in the Detail Browser.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2942: Unknown mam_entity key bgerror
  <li> Bug 3038: athena(1): Revised "Model Parameter" report
  <li> Bug 3039: athena(1): Revise Attitude Driver report

  <li> Bug 3062: athena(1): Mods don't work
  <li> Bug 3064: Update ATTROE Tactic Bgerror
</ul><p>
       

<h3>Build 3.0.22, 15 June 2011</h3>

This is the "pre-vacation" build, getting the latest work into Athena
to allow time for testing before I leave, so that this version can be
used to develop scenarios for the demo in early July while I'm
gone.  The changes are as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 3035: athena(1): Extensions to the Object Tree
  <li> Bug 3036: athena(1): CONTROL rule set
  <li> Bug 3037: my:/parmdb parameters don't update correctly 
</ul><p>


<h3>Build 3.0.21, 13 June 2011</h3>

This package adds the notion of "agents".  An agent is an object that
can have a strategy.  At present there are two kinds of agent: actors,
and the SYSTEM agent.  In addition, it adds two tactics: the ASSIGN
tactic, which actors may use to assign abstract activities to force
and organization group personnel in neighborhoods, and the DISPLACE
tactic, which the SYSTEM actor may use to displace civilian personnel
into other neighborhoods.  Finally, it adds the ability to view and
edit model parameters through the GUI via the "my://app/parmdb" page.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 3020: athena(1): ASSIGN tactic, with related changes
  <li> Bug 3026: athena(1): Agents
  <li> Bug 3028: Sim Object Typos
  <li> Bug 3029: athena(1): DISPLACE tactic
  <li> Bug 3030: Include "rm athena" in install.txt
  <li> Bug 3032: athena(1): Activity Costs
  <li> Bug 3034: athena(1): my://app/parmdb page
</ul>

<h3>Build 3.0.20, 1 June 2011</h3>

This build contains a number of bug fixes and minor tweaks, along with
a significant reorganization of the on-line help.  The full set of
changes are as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2988: Troops condition does not refer to transient values
  <li> Bug 2993: athena(1): ShiftControl fails when neighborhood is in chaos
  <li> Bug 2995: INFLUENCE condition not evaluating properly
  <li> Bug 3009: Attempt to deploy negative personnel bgerror
  <li> Bug 3010: athena(1): Help Scrub, Part II
  <li> Bug 3013: athena(1): no such table: helpdb_pages
  <li> Bug 3014: athena(1): Z.security function for computing actor support
  <li> Bug 3016: athena(1): Belief System Browser, tolerance values
  <li> Bug 3017: athena(1): control analysis vs. control assessment
</ul>

<h3>Build 3.0.19, 24 May 2011</h3>

This build contains the MOBILIZE and ATTROE tactics and the NBCOOP
condition.  In addition, there's been considerable work on the on-line
help; that work is still on-going.  Finally, the "athena(1)" command
now simply invokes the Athena simulation; the "sim" subcommand is no
longer required.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2961: Empty Groups Tab
  <li> Bug 2981: athena_sim(1): MOBILIZE tactic
  <li> Bug 2982: Remove XML import/export

  <li> Bug 2992: athena(1): bgerror at start-up
  <li> Bug 2997: athena(1): Significant Conflicts
  <li> Bug 2998: help(5): Help Objects
  <li> Bug 2999: athena(1): Help Scrub, Part I

  <li> Bug 3004: athena(1): Civilian Group help
  <li> Bug 3006: help(5): Alias pages
</ul>

<h3>Build 3.0.18, 16 May 2011</h3>

This build contains significant improvement in the "condition"
infrastructure, with re-implementations of the existing conditions and
new implementations of many more.  In particular, the GOAL condition
has been replaced by the MET and UNMET conditions, and the CASH condition
can track changes in an actor's cash reserve as his tactics execute.
New conditions include TROOPS, DURING, BEFORE, AFTER, AT, CONTROL, and
INFLUENCE.  Finally, we've added a DEMOB (demobilization) tactic that
allows troops to be explicitly moved out of the playbox.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2944: Cash Reserve Condition Flagged as Unmet
  <li> Bug 2957: DEFROE Bgerror
  <li> Bug 2958: athena_sim(1): DEMOB tactic

  <li> Bug 2976: athena_sim(1): AT condition
  <li> Bug 2977: athena_sim(1): CONTROL condition
  <li> Bug 2978: athena_sim(1): INFLUENCE condition 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 3.0.17, 10 May 2011</h3>

This package removes the old force level management code (the
PERSONNEL:* orders and Groups/Personnel browser) in favor of the
new DEPLOY tactic; five of the packages in this build all relate to
deployment.  In addition, there is a new "significant simulation
events" log; log entries related to each entity can be seen on the
entity pages, and the entire log can be seen at my://app/sigevents.
Finally, there is continued GUI re-organization.  The full set of
packages are as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2941: athena_sim(1): Scenario sanity checks display in Detail Browser
  <li> Bug 2943: No Weekly Income

<h3>Build 3.0.7, 1 February 2011</h3>

This build contains several small changes, and one huge one: the first
implementation of actor tactics and conditions.  There are only two
tactic types and one condition type, and one of the tactic types isn't
fully functional; however, the GUI for create, browsing, and editing
tactics and conditions is well advanced, and the architecture looks
solid.  The full set of changes is as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2740: athena_sim(1): Delete "::coop mutate reconcile"
  <li> Bug 2756: scenariodb(n): Update tclimport/tclexport WRT Bug 2755
  <li> Bug 2757: athena_sim(1): frcgroup mutate update leaves spurious defroe_ng records
  <li> Bug 2790: athena_sim(1): Tactics and Conditions, Part I 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 3.0.6, 4 January 2011</h3>

This build begins the integration of the Mars Affinity Model into
Athena: mam(n) is initialized, and mam(n) entities are created for
each civilian group and actor.  In addition, this build makes use of
SQLite3's support for foreign keys and cascading deletes to greatly
simplify the scenario-editing code.  Finally, FRC and ORG groups now
have owning actors.  The full set of changes is as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2734: athena_sim(1): mam(n) Integration, actor and CIV group editing
  <li> Bug 2735: athena_sim(1); Sat curves created and deleted with CIV groups
  <li> Bug 2736: athena_sim(1): bgerror on SIM:UNLOCK
  <li> Bug 2737: athena_sim(1): Delete "::nbrel reconcile"

  <li> Bug 2741: athena_sim(1): Delete "::personnel mutate reconcile"
  <li> Bug 2742: athena_sim(1): Delete "::attroe mutate reconcile"
  <li> Bug 2743: athena_sim(1): Delete "::defroe mutate reconcile"
  <li> Bug 2744: athena_sim(1): Snapshots cannot contain NULLs
  <li> Bug 2745: athena_sim(1): Delete "::activity mutate reconcile"
  <li> Bug 2746: athena_sim(1): Notes on removing "ensit mutate reconcile"
  <li> Bug 2748: athena_sim(1): FRC and ORG groups have owning actors 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 3.0.5, 20 December 2010</h3>

The bulk of the changes in this build involve streamlining some of the
low-level data handling in Athena.  In particular, Athena modules are
no longer responsible for sending out <Entity> events when entities
(e.g., neighborhoods or groups) change in some way; instead, given
that the relevant changes are all in the RDB, RDB triggers are used to
do automatic row monitoring.<p>

In addition, this build contains the first occurrence of actors in
Athena.  At present, Actors can be created, updated, and modified, but
they don't actually do anything.<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2721: athena_sim(1): Undo cleanup
  <li> Bug 2722: scenariodb(n): Include mam(n) schema
  <li> Bug 2723: athena_sim(1): Automatic row monitoring
  <li> Bug 2726: athena_sim(1): Automatic row monitoring, part II
  <li> Bug 2729: athena_sim(1): longnames no longer require uniqueness
  <li> Bug 2730: athena_sim(1): Actors 
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 3.0.4, 17 November 2010</h3>

<h3>Build 3.0.2, 25 October 2010</h3>

This build contains a number of minor bug fixes, and two significant
changes.  First, Athena now supports scripting of simulation orders.
A script can send orders, and the complete order history can be saved
as a script.  In aid of this, the longer order names have been
considerably shortened; the SITUATION:ENVIRONMENTAL:* orders, for
example, are now the ENSIT:* orders.<p>

Second, the model architecture has been significantly changed: each
civilian group now resides in exactly one neighborhood.  There is no
longer a distinction between toplevel civilian groups and neighborhood
groups.  Groups that would have been neighborhood groups of the same
toplevel group are now modeled as civilian groups with a strong
positive relationship.<p>

The full list of packages is as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2610: More Online Help Glossary Typos
  <li> Bug 2613: athena_sim(1): In NBHOOD:UPDATE:*, vtygain changes are not undone.
  <li> Bug 2621: athena_sim(1): Each civ group resides in one neighborhood
  <li> Bug 2622: Update Scheduled Activity Bgerror
  <li> Bug 2624: EnSit Info Appears on Terminal Window
  <li> Bug 2625: athena_sim(1): Order renaming

</ul><p>

<h3>Build 3.0.1, 11 October 2010</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 2611: Order Dialog Overhaul
  <li> Bug 2614: athena_sim(1): Prepare for GRAM changes 
</ul><p>
