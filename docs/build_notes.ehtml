  <li> Bug: 3406 athena(1): MOOD rule set
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 4.0.1, 24 April 2012</h3>

This is the first Athena 4 build; it contains many changes since
Athena 3.1 was branched from the trunk.  The most significant are that
the tick size is now seven days; that strategies can be used to set up
initial conditions by tagging tactics with the "on lock" flag; and
that GRAM has been replaced with URAM (although URAM integration is
not yet complete; see Bug 3386).  The specific bugs are as follows:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Bug 3337: CM Plan: Release procedure
