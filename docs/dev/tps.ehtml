<h2>Third-party Software List</h2>

Athena depends on the following third-party software during operations:<p>

<ul>
  <li> Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Version 5 (though other versions of
       Linux will probably work just as well).

  <li> Windows 7, 32-bit or 64-bit; the application is built for
       32-bit Windows.

</ul><p>

The following software is required during development, but not during
operations:

<ul>
  <li> ActiveTcl Enterprise 20011Q3, as delivered by ActiveState.

  <li> <a href="http://activestate.com/Products/Tcl_Dev_Kit/?mp=1">
       Tcl Dev Kit 4.1</a> (or later).

  <li> <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>, to build binary Tcl
       extensions on Windows 7. 
  <li> <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php">InnoSetup 5</a>,
       to build the Windows installer.
</ul>
