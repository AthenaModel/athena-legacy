<<section DESCRIPTION>>

<<deflist program>>

<<defitem {athena sim} {athena sim ?<i>filename</i>.ath?}>>

<</deflist program>>

<<xref athena_sim(1)>> is the Athena simulation application.  Details of
the simulation model are to be found in the <i>Athena Analyst's
Guide</i> and related documents, rather than here; this man page
documents simulation operation only.<p>

<<xref athena_sim(1)>> is a documentic-centric application, like a
word-processor; here, however, the documents are Athena scenario
files, which conventionally have a "<code>.ath</code>" extension.<p>

Further documentation is TBD.<p>
