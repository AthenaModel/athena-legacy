<<section SYNOPSIS>>

<<itemlist>>

<<section DESCRIPTION>>

All user inputs to the athena_sim(1) simulation come in as simulation
orders, which are defined by the various simulation modules.  This man
page documents the orders and their parameters.<p>

<<section "GROUP:*">>

The <code>GROUP:*</code> orders are used to create, modify, and
manipulate various kinds of groups.<p>

<<subsection "GROUP:FORCE:*">>

These orders relate to force groups, groups which exist to project force.<p>

<<deflist group force>>

<<defitem GROUP:FORCE:CREATE {GROUP:FORCE:CREATE}>>

Creates a new force group.  The parameters are as
follows:<p>

<<deflist options>>

<<defopt g>>

<b>Required.</b> A brief <<xref ident(n) identifier>> which uniquely
identifies this group.<p>

<<defopt longname>>

<b>Required.</b> A short human-readable name for the neighborhood, e.g., "Los Angeles".<p>

<<defopt color>>

<b>Required.</b>  A color, specified as a hexadecimal RGB string,
"<code>#<i>rrggbb</i></code>" or "<code>#<i>rrrrggggbbbb</i></code>".
This color is used to color code the group's icons.<p>

<<defopt forcetype>>

<b>Required.</b> The force type, as follows:<p>

<<::athlib::eforcetype html>>

<<defopt local>>

<b>Required.</b> The local flag, expressed as a boolean value (e.g.,
"Yes" or "No"). Indicates whether the group is perceived as being
local to the playbox, or as a foreign force.<p> 

<<defopt coalition>>

<b>Required.</b> The coalition flag, expressed as a boolean value
(e.g., "Yes" or "No").  Indicates whether or not the group is a member
of the U.S.-led coalition.<p>

<</deflist options>>

<<defitem GROUP:FORCE:DELETE {GROUP:FORCE:DELETE}>>

Deletes a force group.<p>

TBD: Possibly, all entities depending on the group will be
deleted as well.  Alternatively, the order might be rejected if any
other entities depend on this group.<p>

The parameters are as follows:<p>

<<deflist options>>

<<defopt g>>

<b>Required.</b> The group's ID.<p>

<<defitem GROUP:FORCE:UPDATE {GROUP:FORCE:UPDATE}>>

Updates an existing force group.  The parameters are as
defined for <<iref GROUP:FORCE:CREATE>>; <b>g</b> is required, and
specifies the group to update, while the remainder are optional.<p>

<</deflist group force>>

<<subsection "GROUP:ORGANIZATION:*">>

These orders relate to organization groups, i.e., NGOs, IGOs, and
Contractors, working in the playbox.<p>

<<deflist group organization>>

<<defitem GROUP:ORGANIZATION:CREATE {GROUP:ORGANIZATION:CREATE}>>

Creates a new organization group.  The parameters are as
follows:<p>

<<deflist options>>

<<defopt g>>

<b>Required.</b> A brief <<xref ident(n) identifier>> which uniquely
identifies this group.<p>

<<defopt longname>>

<b>Required.</b> A short human-readable name for the neighborhood, e.g., "Los Angeles".<p>

<<defopt color>>

<b>Required.</b>  A color, specified as a hexadecimal RGB string,
"<code>#<i>rrggbb</i></code>" or "<code>#<i>rrrrggggbbbb</i></code>".
This color is used to color code the group's icons.<p>

<<defopt orgtype>>

<b>Required.</b> The organization type, as follows:<p>

<<::athlib::eorgtype html>>

<<defopt medical>>

<b>Required.</b> The medical capability flag, expressed as a boolean value (e.g.,
"Yes" or "No"). Indicates whether the group can provide healthcare to
local civilians.<p> 

<<defopt engineer>>

<b>Required.</b> The engineering capability flag, expressed as a boolean value
(e.g., "Yes" or "No").  Indicates whether or not the group can provide
engineering services to the local civilians.<p>

<<defopt support>>

<b>Required.</b> The support capability flag, expressed as a boolean value
(e.g., "Yes" or "No").  Indicates whether or not the group provides
support (food, water, education, etc.) to the local civilians.<p>

<<defopt rollup_weight>>

<b>Required.</b> The rollup weight, used when rolling up the group's
satisfaction levels to the playbox level.  A non-negative floating
point value, nominally 1.0.<p>

<<defopt effects_factor>>

<b>Required.</b> The indirect effects factor, which scales indirect
effects on other groups of satisfaction effects on this group.  A
non-negative floating point value, nominally 1.0.<p>

<</deflist options>>

<<defitem GROUP:ORGANIZATION:DELETE {GROUP:ORGANIZATION:DELETE}>>

Deletes a organization group.<p>

TBD: Possibly, all entities depending on the group will be
deleted as well.  Alternatively, the order might be rejected if any
other entities depend on this group.<p>

The parameters are as follows:<p>

<<deflist options>>

<<defopt g>>

<b>Required.</b> The group's ID.<p>

<<defitem GROUP:ORGANIZATION:UPDATE {GROUP:ORGANIZATION:UPDATE}>>

Updates an existing organization group.  The parameters are as
defined for <<iref GROUP:ORGANIZATION:CREATE>>; <b>g</b> is required, and
specifies the group to update, while the remainder are optional.<p>

<</deflist group organization>>


<<section "MAP:*">>

The <code>MAP:*</code> orders relate to the map display, and are implemented
by the <<xref map(sim)>> module.<p>

follows:<p>

<<deflist options>>

<<defopt filename>>

<b>Required.</b> The name of the image file to import and use as a map.

<</deflist options>>

<<section "NBHOOD:*">>

The <code>NBHOOD:*</code> orders are used to create and manipulate map
regions called neighborhoods.  They are implemented
