Athena 2.1 Installation Instructions
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Athena is designed to run under Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5,
   but is known to run under other Linux distributions as well,
   notably Ubuntu.  If in doubt, give it a try.

2. Athena can be installed in any directory you choose.  It is
   most typically installed in your home directory as '~/athena'.

3. In what follows, "3.1.x" refers to the Athena version number;
   replace it with the actual version number, e.g., "3.1.0".

4. Copy the installation tarball to your home directory (or any 
   other location of your choosing).

5. Untar the installation tarball from a Terminal window by typing 

      tar zxf athena_3.1.x.tgz

   (Again, "3.1.x" is the version number in the installation file
   name, e.g., "3.1.0".)

6. Create an "athena_3.1.x" directory link in your home directory 
   and link ~/athena to it:

      ln -s ~/athena_3.1.x athena

7. Add '~/athena/bin' to your $PATH environment variable by editing 
   the file ".bash_profile" and adding the line 

      export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/athena/bin

   after the last "export PATH" statement.

8. Create a bookmark in your web browser that points to the file 
   '~/athena/docs/index.html'; this is the top of the Athena 
   documentation tree.

9. Launch the Athena simulation application using the following 
   command in a terminal window:

      athena sim

10. The athena scenario files may be stored in any directory in 
    your account that you choose.  Typically, users will create a 
    subdirectory for each scenario, but that's up to you.
