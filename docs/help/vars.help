    <<title>>
    Athena provides the ability to plot or otherwise visualize a 
    wide variety of <i>display variables</i>.  There are two kinds:<p>

    <ul>
    <li> <<cref var.n>>
    <li> <<cref var.t>>
    </ul>

    Every display variable name consists of a variable type, possibly 
    followed by one or more index values.  For example, the
    neighborhood variable <b>sat.SHIA.SFT</b> is the <<term satisfaction>> of 
    of the SHIA group with respect to its SFT concern across
    neighborhoods.<p>

    The valid index values generally vary from scenario to scenario;
    thus, this documentation describes families of variables like
    this:<p>

    <b>sat.<i>g.c</i></b><p>

    is the <<term satisfaction>> of group <i>g</i> with concern <i>c</i> across
    neighborhoods.

# Formats the header for the command, including a link to the parent

# Neighborhood Variables

page var.n "Neighborhood Variables" vars {
    <<title>>
    A <i>neighborhood variable</i> is a
    <<cref vars "display variable">> whose value varies across
    neighborhoods. For example, the
    neighborhood variable <b>sat.SHIA.SFT</b> is the <<term satisfaction>> of 
    of the SHIA group with respect to its SFT concern across
    neighborhoods.<p>

    The available variable types are as follows:<p>

    <<childlinks>>
}

var n cap {
    <<vartitle>>
    The production capacity for goods of each neighborhood, in
    goodsBKT/year.
}

var n coop {
    <<vartitle f g>>
    The <<term cooperation>> of group <i>f</i> with group <i>g</i> across
    neighborhoods.
}

var n coop0 {
    <<vartitle f g>>
    The <<term cooperation>> of group <i>f</i> with group <i>g</i> across
    neighborhoods at time 0.
}

var n cov {
    <<vartitle g a>>
    The <<term coverage>> fraction for <<term activity>> <i>a</i> by 
    group <i>g</i>.
}

var n mood {
    <<vartitle g>>
    The <<term mood>> (composite <<term satisfaction>>) of group
    <i>g</i> across neighborhoods.
}

var n mood0 {
    <<vartitle g>>
    The <<term mood>> (composite <<term satisfaction>>) of group
    <i>g</i> across neighborhoods at time 0.
}

var n nbcoop {
    <<vartitle g>>
    The overall <<term cooperation>> of each neighborhood with group <i>g</i>.
}

var n nbmood {
    <<vartitle>>
    The overall <<term mood>> (composite <<term satisfaction>>) across
    neighborhoods.
}

var n nbmood0 {
    <<vartitle>>
    The overall <<term mood>> (composite <<term satisfaction>>) across
    neighborhoods at time 0.
}

var n none {
    <<vartitle>>
    A null variable, 0 for all neighborhoods.
}

var n pcf {
    <<vartitle>>
    The production capacity factor for goods across neighborhoods.
    A number less than 1.0 indicates that production
    capacity has been destroyed or disabled; a number greater than
    1.0 indicates that new capacity has been built.
}

var n sat {
    <<vartitle g c>>
    The <<term satisfaction>> of group <i>g</i> with respect to concern
    <i>c</i> across neighborhoods.
}

var n sat0 {
    <<vartitle g c>>
    The <<term satisfaction>> of group <i>g</i> with respect to concern
    <i>c</i> across neighborhoods at time 0.
}

var n sec {
    <<vartitle g>>
    The <<term security>> of group <i>g</i> across neighborhoods.
}

# Time Series Variables

page var.t "Time Series Variables" vars {
    <<title>>
    A <i>time series variable</i> is a
    <<cref vars "display variable">> whose value varies with time.
    For example, the
    time series variable <b>sat.N1.SHIA.SFT</b> is the <<term satisfaction>>
    of the SHIA group in neighborhood N1 with respect to its SFT
    concern over time.<p>

    The available variable types are as follows:<p>

    <<childlinks>>
}

var t coop {
    <<vartitle n f g>>
    The <<term cooperation>> of civilian group <i>f</i> with force
    group <i>g</i> in neighborhood <i>n</i> over time.
}

var t mood {
    <<vartitle n g>>
    The <<term mood>> of group <i>g</i> in neighborhood <i>n</i> 
    over time.
}

var t nbcoop {
    <<vartitle n g>>
    The <<term cooperation>> of the civilians in neighborhood <i>n</i>
    with force group <i>g</i> over time.
}

var t nbmood {
    <<vartitle n>>
    The <<term mood>> of the civilians in neighborhood <i>n</i> 
    over time.
}

var t sat {
    <<vartitle n g c>>
    The <<term satisfaction>> of group <i>g</i> with respect to
    <<term concern>> <i>c</i> in neighborhood <i>n</i> 
    over time.
}
