# DESCRIPTION:
#    Athena Help Documentation: Application Tabs
#
#    This file is included into athena.help.
#
#    Individual tabs have titles like "Groups/Civilian".  The page paths
#    are created automatically by downcasing and converting blanks to
#    underscores, e.g., 
#    
#       /tab/groups/civilian
#    
#    The tab macro creates a link to a tab page given its label.

    <<title>>
    Athena displays scenario data in a collection of tabbed windows, or 
    <i>tabs</i>.  Many of the tabs have subtabs.  The full set of tabs 
    is as follows:<p>

# Map Tab

tab "Map" {
    The Map tab contains the Athena Map Viewer, the primary means of
    visualizing Athena scenarios.  The Map Viewer is where 
    <<cref /order/nbhood neighborhoods>> and <<cref /order/unit units>> are drawn,
    <<cref /order/ensit "environmental situations">>  are 
    created and positioned, and group moods and other <<cref /var/n>>
    are visualized.  The
    browser controls are described <<seebelow controls>>.<p>

    <b>Basics:</b> For the most part, using the Map Viewer is
    intuitive.  See the <i>Athena User's Guide</i> for information on map
    cooperations and importing a map background into the scenario,
    and for information on defining a scenario.<p>

    <b><a name="controls">Browser Controls:</a></b>  The Map Viewer
    has two toolbars, the manipulation toolbar along the left-hand
    side and the visualization toolbar across the top.  These toolbars
    contain the following controls:<p>

    <<topiclist Control Description>>

    <<topic [image button_arrow]>>
    Press this button to enable selection mode.  In this mode,
    clicking on an object prints a brief description of the object to
    the message line at the bottom of the window.  In addition, you
    can control-click to drag units and environmental situations from
    one place to another.  Simply press the <b>Ctrl</b> key, click on
    the unit or situation, holding down the mouse button, and drag the
    object to its new location.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_pan]>>
    Press this button to enable panning mode.  In panning mode, click
    and drag the map to pan from one part of the map to another.
    Alternatively, use the scroll bars.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_location]>>
    Press this button to enable location-entry mode, i.e., to enter a
    <<term mapref>> into an order dialog or the CLI.<p>

    It is rarely necessary to select this mode explicitly, as the
    order dialogs select it automatically when the current order field
    expects a <<term mapref>>. 
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_poly]>>
    Press this button to enable polygon-entry mode, i.e., to enter a
    polygon (defined by a list of <<term mapref>>s) into an order
    dialog or the CLI.<p>

    It is rarely necessary to select this mode explicitly, as the
    order dialogs select it automatically when the current order field
    expects a polygon.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_nbhood]>>
    Press this button to pop up the 
    <<cref /order/nbhood/create>> order dialog.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_ensit]>>
    Press this button to pop up the 
    <<cref /order/ensit/create>> order
    dialog.  Alternatively, right-click on the map and select
    <<cref /order/ensit/create>> from the context
    menu--this will pop up the order dialog with the selected location
    already filled in.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_mapref]>>
    This control shows the <<term mapref>> of the location under the
    mouse pointer.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_extmap]>>
    Map reference strings address a square region; if the map in use
    is not a square, there is a strip of unused space on the
    righthand-side or along the bottom.  If this button is selected,
    this excess space is available as a place to position units or to
    draw neighborhoods for remote regions.  Otherwise, all objects
    must be on the map proper.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_nbfill]>>
    By default, neighborhood polygons are transparent, revealing the
    map background beneath.  If this button is selected, the polygons
    will be filled with some color, nominally white.  See the
    neighborhood fill type control, next, for other choices.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_filltype]>>
    When the neighborhood fill button is selected, neighborhood
    polygons are filled with color based on some 
    <<cref /var/n "Neighborhood Variable">>.  This pulldown determines the
    which variable is used.  Note that some variables are unavailable
    during <<term prep>>.<p>

    The pulldown is initially populated with a number of neighborhood
    variables; others can be requested using the <<command nbfill>> 
    command.

    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_zoom]>>
    This pulldown controls the zoom level.  By default, the map is
    drawn at 100%, its actual size.  Select one of the other zoom
    levels to scale it up or down.  <b>Note:</b> the first time a
    zoom level is chosen, there may be a delay as the map is scaled.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic "Context Menus">>Most objects drawn on the map have
    context menus.  Right-click to pop up the menu.
    <</topic>>

    <</topiclist>>

#=======================================================================
# Detail Tab

tab "Detail" {
    The Detail tab contains the Detail Browser, which is the central
    part of the Athena user interface, and the primary spot for
    viewing scenario inputs, outputs, and the on-line help.  

    In form, the Detail Browser resembles a web browser: it displays
    pages of HTML-formatted data, each of which has its own URL.  The
    user can navigate the data by clicking on links, by use of the
    back and forward buttons, and by entering specific URLs into the
    browser's address bar.  However, the Detail Browser does not
    implement true web access; it will only display data from within
    the application, not data from external web pages.<p>

    The Detail Browser has several distinctive parts:<p>

    <ul>
    <li> <b>The Toolbar</b>, which contains standard browsing
         tools.<p>

    <li> <b>The <<cref /tab/detail/sidebar Sidebar>></b>, which provides quick
         links to many of the available pages.<p>

    <li> <b>The Data Pane</b>, in which pages are displayed.  The data
         page has a helpful <<cref /tab/detail/context "context menu">>.
    </ul>

    The toolbar controls are as follows:<p>

    <<topiclist Control Description>>

    <<topic [image button_backward]>>
    Press to go back to the previously displayed page.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_forward]>>
    After pressing the back button, press this to return to the page
    that was left.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_home]>>
    Go to the application's home page.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_reload]>>
    Reload the current page.  (This is not usually necessary, as
    Athena will usually reload the displayed page when data changes.)
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_plus]>>
    Bookmark the current page.  Bookmarks appear on the 
    <<cref /menu/bookmarks>> and can be edited on the
    <<tab Bookmarks>>.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_addressbar]>>
    The address bar; enter a page's URL here to go straight to that page.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_search]>>
    The search box; enter a search string to find the related on-line help.
    <</topic>>

    <</topiclist>>
}

page /tab/detail sidebar "Detail Browser Sidebar" {
    <<title>>

    The <<cref /tab/detail "Detail Browser's">> sidebar contains links
    to various useful pages.<p>

    <<image control_dbsidebar>>

    The sidebar has two tabs, the "Objects" tab, which has pages
    related to the simulation objects and outputs, and the "?" tab,
    which displays the tree of on-line help pages.  Click on the "+"
    icons to open and close topics; and click on the topics to go to
    the indicated page.<p>
}

page /tab/detail context "Detail Browser Context Menu" {
    <<title>>

    Right-clicking with the mouse on the 
    <<cref /tab/detail "Detail Browser's">> data pane brings up a
    context menu with the following menu items:<p>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Save to Disk...</b>
    <dd> Saves the HTML text of the page to disk as a .html file.<p>

    <dt><b>View in System Web Browser...</b>
    <dd> Saves the HTML text to disk, and opens it in the system's
         default web browser.  The formatting may be somewhat
         different, and images might be missing; however, this is a
         convenient way to print the text.<p>

    <dt><b>View Source...</b>
    <dd> Displays the HTML source for the current page in a window.
    </dl>

}


#=======================================================================
# Strategy Tab

tab "Strategy" {
    The Strategy tab is where the analyst browses and edits each
    <<term agent>>'s <<term strategy>>: the agent's <<term goal>>s
    and the collection of <<term tactic>>s the agent will use to 
    achieve them.<p>

    The Strategy tab shows the strategy for one agent at a time.  It
    consists of several panes, each with its own controls:<p>

    <ul>
    <li> <b>The Agent List</b>: A list of all of the agents in the
    simulation.  Selecting an agent in the list displays the agent's
    strategy in the other panes.</li>

    <li> <b>The <<cref /tab/strategy/goals_tree>></b>: This pane shows
    the agent's  
    goals, along with all attached conditions.  A goal is deemed to be
    met when all attached conditions are true.  The analyst creates,
    edits, and browses goals in this pane.
    </li>

    <li> <b>The <<cref /tab/strategy/tactics_tree>></b>:  This pane
    shows the agent's 
    tactics in priority order, along with all attached conditions.
    The analyst creates, edits, and browses tactics in this pane.</li>

    </ul>
}

page /tab/strategy goals_tree "Goals Tree" {
    <<title>>

    The Goals Tree shows the <<term goal>>s currently defined for
    the <<term agent>> shown in the Agent List, along with all
    attached <<term condition>>s.  A goal is said to be "met" when
    all of the attached conditions are met, and "unmet" otherwise.
    The Goals Tree consists of a tool bar containing controls used in
    creating, editing, and manipulating goals and conditions, and an 
    outline view of the agent's goals with the conditions
    attached to each goal indented underneath.  The user can expand
    or collapse each goal to show or hide the attached
    conditions.<p>

    <<topiclist Column Description>>

    <<topic "Goal/Condition">>
    A narrative description of each goal and condition, preceded by
    a status icon that indicates whether or not the goal or condition is 
    currently met.<p>

    A button at the left margin allows goals to be expand to reveal
    their attached conditions.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic "Id">> The goal or condition ID, a number that uniquely
    identifies the goal or condition.<p>

page /tab/strategy tactics_tree "Tactics Tree" {
    <<title>>

    The Tactics Tree shows the <<term tactic>>s currently defined for
    the <<term agent>> shown in the Agent List, along with all
    attached <<term condition>>s.  It 
    consists of a tool bar containing controls used in creating,
    editing, and manipulating tactics and conditions, and an outline
    view of the agent's tactics in priority order with the conditions
    attached to each tactic indented underneath.  The user can expand

    browser shows the natural,

    baseline value.  The baseline value defaults to the natural level,
    but can be overridden by the user.  Default baselines are
    shown in green text; overridden baselines are shown in red text.

    Initially, horizontal relationships are computed automatically from the 
    belief systems model; civilian groups have their own 
    belief systems, and force and organization groups inherit the
    belief systems of their owning actors.  Computed relationships
    are shown in green text.<p>

    Additionally, the analyst can override any initial relationship
    with a specific value; these manually-entered relationships are
    shown in red text.<p>

    <<topic "Natural">> The natural relationship between group F and
    group G from F's point of view, as derived from the affinity
    between the two groups.  It will be the same as the baseline value
    unless the baseline has been overridden by the analyst.  In the

    browser shows the natural,
    affinity-based level for each relationship, along with the initial
    baseline value.  The baseline value defaults to the natural level,
    but can be overridden by the user.  Default baselines are
    shown in green text; overridden baselines are shown in red text.

    Initially, vertical relationships are computed automatically from the 
    belief systems model; civilian groups and actors have their own 
    belief systems, and force and organization groups inherit the
    belief systems of their owning actors.  Computed relationships
    are shown in green text.<p>

    Additionally, the analyst can override any initial relationship
    with a specific value; these manually-entered relationships are
    shown in red text.<p>

# Econ

tab "Econ" {
    The subtabs of the Econ tab display various data related to the 
    Economics model.  The full set of subtabs is as follows:<p>

    <<childlinks>>
}

tab "Econ/SAM" {

    This tab displays a social accounting matrix (SAM) of the economy
    in spreadsheet form.<p>

    <<image econ_sam>><p>

    The SAM Inputs area shows the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM), sector 
    by sector,and related inputs and outputs. The SAM is displayed in
    two forms: the presumed size given the number of consumers and the
    resultant shape. The former is displayed a the top of the tab and
    contains monetary values, the latter at the bottom and contains the
    coefficients and rates that are used in the Econ model's Computable
    Equilibrium Model (CGE) matrix.<p>

    Cells that are a light green color are editable and it is these cells
    that the analyst should use when defining the money flows between 
    the sectors of the economy. Each time a cell is updated the shape
    parameters are automatically recomputed and displayed.<p>

    The grey cells in the upper matrix are computed from the green cells. Base
    revenues and base expenditures are computed from the rows and columns of 
    the matrix respectively and then, given base prices in the goods, 
    black and population sectors, base quantities (or more precisely, base 
    demand) is computed.<p>

    For the goods sector, a goods basket (goodsBKT) is the unit of measurement.
    A goods basket is simply a notional set of goods that the population
    buys and it's associated price (defaulted to 1 USD per basket).
    For the black sector, a metric ton (tonne) is the unit of measurement
    and the demand is simply the revenue divided by the price per tonne.
    For the population sector, base demand is labor output of the workforce
    in work-years given the average annual income of a typical person in
    the area of interest.<p>

    The Other Inputs section allows the user to supply, in order, remittances
    to the economy, the black market feedstock price in dollars per year,
    the feedstock per unit of black market product (for example, if it takes 
    1.05 tons of poppies to make 1 ton of opium, then this value would be 
    1.05), the maximum amount of black market feedstock available, the 
    number of consumers that the data in the SAM is based upon and the
    subsistence farmer wage, which is also the poverty level.  The 
    subsistence wage is used to compute the contribution of subsistence
    agriculture to the GDP.<p>

    When Athena is locked, all the cells on the SAM remain visible, but are
    no longer editable unless the user returns to the PREP state.<p>

    The SAM outputs section contains values that are either already in the 
    SAM but have a special meaning to the economy or are computed from other
    values in the SAM. The Foreign Aid to Actors is
    the same as the BX.actors.world cell in the SAM and Foreign Aid to 
    Region is the same as the BX.region.world cell. The per capita demand
    for goods in goodsBKT/year is computed from the BX.goods.pop cell in
    the SAM and the Base Consumers cell in the other inputs section. The base
    amount of goods exported is the ratio of the BX.goods.world cell and the
    price of goods. The amount of exports from the black market is the ratio
    of the BX.black.world cell and the price in the black market. The number
    of exported jobs is the ratio of BX.pop.world and the price of labor.
    These values are used in the solution of the CGE. Refer to the CGE 
    documentation for how they are used.<p>

    Finally, the shape parameters are computed from the size of the economy.
    These values are used with other key values, such as the price of black
    market feedstock to compute the actual flows of money between sectors as
    Athena runs forward in time.<p>

    <b>Note:</b> The definition of actors and where they get their income, 
    along with their strategies and Athena parameters that define how actors
    spend their income will result in the actors sector money flows being
    recomputed when Athena is locked. 
}

tab "Econ/Overview" {
    <b>Simulation Mode only.</b><p>

    This tab displays the current state of the economy in two ways: in the
    "Dollars" matrix, as flows of money between the sectors of the economy and
    in the "Quantities" matrix as flows of product between the applicable 
    sectors of the economy. The actors, region and world sectors either do
    not have product (actors) or do not produce a product that matters to
    the local economy (region and world).<p>

    Below the "Dollars" and "Quantities" matrices are inputs to the economy
    that size it and the most salient outputs.<p>

    <<image econ_current>><p>

    The size of the economy is driven by the
    number of consumers and the size of the labor force.  The Consumer 
    Security Factor (or CSF) is the fraction of the consumers that are 
    willing to go out and buy things and the Labor Security Factor, 
    or LSF, determines how many of the workers are actually willing 
    to go to work under current conditions. The graft factor as
    computed by how much money the actors are receiving from skimming off
    foreign aid to the region appears next. Increasing the amount of 
    income from graft in the actor definitions will increase this factor.
    Lastly, the amount of remittances as specified in the 
    <<cref /tab/econ/sam>> appears.<p>

    The most salient outputs consist of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
    the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Deflated GDP, the per capita 
    Deflated GDP, the average per capita demand for goods, the number of 
    unemployed workers in the playbox along 
    with the unemployment rate.  The amount of the labor force afraid to 
    go to work due to not enough security is the Unsecure Labor Force. 
    This number is part of Unemployment.<p>

    Below that, shortages are displayed:  the shortage in the goods sector
    is determined by the unconstrained demand for goods and the constrained
    supply, the shortage in the black market is determined by the 
    unconstrained demand for black market goods and the constrained supply,
    and the shortage of labor as defined by the unconstrained demand in the 
    population sector and the available (constrained) labor force.<p>
}

tab "Econ/Capacity" {
    <b>Simulation Mode only.</b><p>

    This tab displays the production capacity statistics for
    each local neighborhood.  The browser controls are described

# Log

tab "Log" {
    <b>This tab and its subtabs can be made visible by selecting the
    <<menu "View/Scrolling Log">> menu item.</b><p>

    As Athena runs, it produces a detailed log of its operation.  This
    log is primarily intended for aid in debugging, but it can
    sometimes be useful to the user as well.  The Log tab gives access
    to this debugging log.<p>

    The log browser contains the following elements:<p>

    <ul>
    <li> At the top, a tool bar containing the 
         <<seebelow controls "browser controls">>.
    <li> On the left, a 
         <<seebelow loglist "list of the log files">>
         created during this session.
    <li> On the right, the 
         <<seebelow contents "contents">>
         of the currently-selected log.
    </ul><p>

    <b><a name="contents">Log Contents:</a></b>  A log file contains a
    sequence of log entries.  Each log entry begins with the 
    <<term jweek>> string at which it was logged.  This is followed by the 
    <<term loglevel>>, and then by the name of the application module
    that wrote the entry to the log, e.g., <b>sim</b>.  Finally comes
    the log text proper, which might wrap onto multiple lines if
    appropriate.<p>

    <b><a name="loglist">Log List:</a></b> As Athena runs it produces
    a series of log files; the log list lists these files in the order
    of creation.  By default the most recent file is selected; click
    on any file in the list to browse its contents.<p>

    Athena opens a new log file whenever any of the following events
    occur:<p>

    <ul>
    <li> At start-up (<b>start</b>)
    <li> When a new scenario is created (<b>new</b>)
    <li> When an existing scenario is opened (<b>open</b>)
    <li> When saving the scenario under a new name (<b>saveas</b>)
    <li> When entering <<term snapshot>> mode (<b>snapshot</b>)
    <li> When leaving snapshot mode and re-entering the 
         <<term prep>> state. (<b>prep</b>)
    <li> When leaving snapshot mode and re-entering the paused
         state. (<b>latest</b>) 
    <li> When the current log file grows too large.
    </ul><p>

    The log file name contains a serial number, starting at 
    00001, and a suffix that indicates why the new log file was
    opened; the suffixes are shown in parenthesis, above.  If the new
    log file was created because the previous file was too large, the
    new file's name will have no suffix.<p>

    <b><a name="controls">Browser Controls:</a></b>  The browser's
    toolbar contains the following controls:<p>

    <<topiclist Control Description>>
    <<topic [image control_loglevel]>>
    <b><<term loglevel Log-Level>></b>.  This control determines the
    severity of the log entries that are displayed.  By default,
    entries of severity <b>normal</b> and above are displayed, and
    entries with severity of <b>detail</b> and <b>debug</b> are
    not.<p>

    The most common use of this control is to select <b>detail</b>
    from the pulldown so that detailed log entries are displayed.
    <</topic>>

    <<control.filterbox>>

    <<topic [image control_logtar]>> <b>Search Text.</b>  The
    next control allows the user to enter a search text string.  The
    browser will highlight all entries in the current log file that
    match the search text.<p>

    By default, the browser looks for an exact match of the text;
    click on the magnifying glass icon to pop up a menu of other
    options.<p>

    Click on the "circle-x" icon to delete the search text and remove
    the highlighting from the log entries.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_logsrch]>> <b>Search Back
    Controls.</b>  By default, the browser searches for the search
    text only in the current log file.  Use these controls to search
    back through the list of log files (the upward-pointing triangles)
    and back down again (the downward-pointing triangles).  Press the
    stop button (the black square) if searching is taking too long.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_logcnt]>> <b>Found Entry Count.</b>
    When the user enters search text, the browser shows the number of
    found entries, as well as the index of the currently displayed
    entry.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_logvcr]>> <b>VCR Controls.</b>
    Use these controls to navigate to the entries containing the
    search text in the current log file.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_lock]>>
    <b>Auto-Scroll</b>.  Normally, the log browser automatically
    jumps to the latest log entry as new entries are written.
    Toggle this button to prevent the browser from jumping to the
    latest log entry while you are looking at something else.
    Untoggle the button to restore the usual behavior.
