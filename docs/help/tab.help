# DESCRIPTION:
#    Athena Help Documentation: Application Tabs
#
#    This file is included into athena.help.
#
#    Individual tabs have titles like "Groups/Civilian".  The page paths
#    are created automatically by downcasing and converting blanks to
#    underscores, e.g., 
#    
#       /tab/groups/civilian
#    
#    The tab macro creates a link to a tab page given its label.

page / tab "Application Tabs" {
    <<title>>
    Athena displays scenario data in a collection of tabbed windows, or 
    <i>tabs</i>.  Many of the tabs have subtabs.  The full set of tabs 
    is as follows:<p>

# Detail Tab

tab "Detail" {
    The Detail tab contains the Detail Browser, which is the central
    part of the Athena user interface, and the primary spot for
    viewing scenario inputs, outputs, and the on-line help.  

    In form, the Detail Browser resembles a web browser: it displays
    pages of HTML-formatted data, each of which has its own URL.  The
    user can navigate the data by clicking on links, by use of the
    back and forward buttons, and by entering specific URLs into the
    browser's address bar.  However, the Detail Browser does not
    implement true web access; it will only display data from within
    the application, not data from external web pages.<p>

    The Detail Browser has several distinctive parts:<p>

    <ul>
    <li> <b>The Toolbar</b>, which contains standard browsing
         tools.<p>

    <li> <b>The <<cref /tab/detail/sidebar Sidebar>></b>, which provides quick
         links to many of the available pages.<p>

    <li> <b>The Data Pane</b>, in which pages are displayed.  The data
         page has a helpful <<cref /tab/detail/context "context menu">>.
    </ul>

    The toolbar controls are as follows:<p>

    <<topiclist Control Description>>

    <<topic [image button_backward]>>
    Press to go back to the previously displayed page.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_forward]>>
    After pressing the back button, press this to return to the page
    that was left.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_home]>>
    Go to the application's home page.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_reload]>>
    Reload the current page.  (This is not usually necessary, as
    Athena will usually reload the displayed page when data changes.)
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_plus]>>
    Bookmark the current page.  Bookmarks appear on the 
    <<cref /menu/bookmarks>> and can be edited on the
    <<tab Bookmarks>>.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_addressbar]>>
    The address bar; enter a page's URL here to go straight to that page.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_search]>>
    The search box; enter a search string to find the related on-line help.
    <</topic>>

    <</topiclist>>
}

page /tab/detail sidebar "Detail Browser Sidebar" {
    <<title>>

    The <<cref /tab/detail "Detail Browser's">> sidebar contains links
    to various useful pages.<p>

    <<image control_dbsidebar>><p>

    The sidebar has two tabs, the "Objects" tab, which has pages
    related to the simulation objects and outputs, and the "?" tab,
    which displays the tree of on-line help pages.  Click on the "+"
    icons to open and close topics; and click on the topics to go to
    the indicated page.<p>
}

page /tab/detail context "Detail Browser Context Menu" {
    <<title>>

    Right-clicking with the mouse on the 
    <<cref /tab/detail "Detail Browser's">> data pane brings up a
    context menu with the following menu items:<p>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Save to Disk...</b>
    <dd> Saves the HTML text of the page to disk as a .html file.<p>

    <dt><b>View in System Web Browser...</b>
    <dd> Saves the HTML text to disk, and opens it in the system's
         default web browser.  The formatting may be somewhat
         different, and images might be missing; however, this is a
         convenient way to print the text.<p>

    <dt><b>View Source...</b>
    <dd> Displays the HTML source for the current page in a window.
    </dl>

}


#=======================================================================
# Map Tab

tab "Map" {
    The Map tab contains the Athena Map Viewer, the primary means of
    visualizing Athena scenarios.  The Map Viewer is where 
    <<cref /order/nbhood neighborhoods>> and <<cref /order/unit units>> are drawn,
    <<cref /order/ensit "environmental situations">>  are 
    created and positioned, and group moods and other <<cref /var/n>>
    are visualized.  The
    browser controls are described <<seebelow controls>>.<p>

    <b>Basics:</b> For the most part, using the Map Viewer is
    intuitive.  See the <i>Athena User's Guide</i> for information on map
    cooperations and importing a map background into the scenario,
    and for information on defining a scenario.<p>

    <b><a name="controls">Browser Controls:</a></b>  The Map Viewer
    has two toolbars, the manipulation toolbar along the left-hand
    side and the visualization toolbar across the top.  These toolbars
    contain the following controls:<p>

    <<topiclist Control Description>>

    <<topic [image button_arrow]>>
    Press this button to enable selection mode.  In this mode,
    clicking on an object prints a brief description of the object to
    the message line at the bottom of the window.  In addition, you
    can control-click to drag units and environmental situations from
    one place to another.  Simply press the <b>Ctrl</b> key, click on
    the unit or situation, holding down the mouse button, and drag the
    object to its new location.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_pan]>>
    Press this button to enable panning mode.  In panning mode, click
    and drag the map to pan from one part of the map to another.
    Alternatively, use the scroll bars.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_location]>>
    Press this button to enable location-entry mode, i.e., to enter a
    <<term mapref>> into an order dialog or the CLI.<p>

    It is rarely necessary to select this mode explicitly, as the
    order dialogs select it automatically when the current order field
    expects a <<term mapref>>. 
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_poly]>>
    Press this button to enable polygon-entry mode, i.e., to enter a
    polygon (defined by a list of <<term mapref>>s) into an order
    dialog or the CLI.<p>

    It is rarely necessary to select this mode explicitly, as the
    order dialogs select it automatically when the current order field
    expects a polygon.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_nbhood]>>
    Press this button to pop up the 
    <<cref /order/nbhood/create>> order dialog.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_ensit]>>
    Press this button to pop up the 
    <<cref /order/ensit/create>> order
    dialog.  Alternatively, right-click on the map and select
    <<cref /order/ensit/create>> from the context
    menu--this will pop up the order dialog with the selected location
    already filled in.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_mapref]>>
    This control shows the <<term mapref>> of the location under the
    mouse pointer.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_extmap]>>
    Map reference strings address a square region; if the map in use
    is not a square, there is a strip of unused space on the
    righthand-side or along the bottom.  If this button is selected,
    this excess space is available as a place to position units or to
    draw neighborhoods for remote regions.  Otherwise, all objects
    must be on the map proper.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_nbfill]>>
    By default, neighborhood polygons are transparent, revealing the
    map background beneath.  If this button is selected, the polygons
    will be filled with some color, nominally white.  See the
    neighborhood fill type control, next, for other choices.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_filltype]>>
    When the neighborhood fill button is selected, neighborhood
    polygons are filled with color based on some 
    <<cref /var/n "Neighborhood Variable">>.  This pulldown determines the
    which variable is used.  Note that some variables are unavailable
    during <<term prep>>.<p>

    The pulldown is initially populated with a number of neighborhood
    variables; others can be requested using the <<command nbfill>> 
    command.

    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_zoom]>>
    This pulldown controls the zoom level.  By default, the map is
    drawn at 100%, its actual size.  Select one of the other zoom
    levels to scale it up or down.  <b>Note:</b> the first time a
    zoom level is chosen, there may be a delay as the map is scaled.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic "Context Menus">>Most objects drawn on the map have
    context menus.  Right-click to pop up the menu.
    <</topic>>

#=======================================================================
# Strategy Tab

tab "Strategy" {
    The Strategy tab is where the analyst browses and edits each
    <<term agent>>'s <<term strategy>>.  A strategy consists of the 
    collection of <<term tactic tactics>> the agent will use to 
    achieve his goals, organized into <<term block blocks>>.<p>

    The Strategy tab shows the strategy for one agent at a time.  It
    consists of several panes, each with its own controls:<p>

    <ul>
    <li> <b>The Agent List</b>: A list of all of the agents in the
    simulation.  Selecting an agent in the list displays the agent's
    strategy in the other panes.<p>

    <li> <b>The <<cref /tab/strategy/blocks>></b>: This pane shows
    the blocks in the agent's strategy, with the block metadata.  The
    analyst creates, edits, and browses blocks in this pane.<p>

    <li> <b>The Overview Subtab</b>: This subtab shows
        an overview of the current selected block, including all 
        execution constraints, conditions, and tactics.  This is
        the normal way to browse the block's details.<p>

    <li> <b>The <<cref /tab/strategy/conditions>></b>: This subtab
        shows the <<term condition conditions>> attached to the currently 
        selected block.  The analyst creates and edits conditions in 
        this subtab.<p>

    <li> <b>The <<cref /tab/strategy/tactics>></b>: This subtab
        shows the <<term tactic tactics>> attached to the currently 
        selected block.  The analyst creates and edits tactics in 
        this subtab.<p>
    </ul>
}

page /tab/strategy blocks "Blocks List" {
    <<title>>

    The Blocks list shows the <<term block blocks>> in the strategy
    of the <<term agent>> shown in the Agent List.  The user can

    but can be overridden by the user.  Default baselines are
    shown in green text; overridden baselines are shown in red text.

    Initially, vertical relationships are computed automatically from the 
    belief systems model; civilian groups and actors have their own 
    belief systems, and force and organization groups inherit the
    belief systems of their owning actors.  Computed relationships
    are shown in green text.<p>

    with a specific value; these manually-entered relationships are
    shown in red text.<p>

# Econ

tab "Econ" {
    The subtabs of the Econ tab display various data related to the 
    Economics model.  The full set of subtabs is as follows:<p>

    <<childlinks>>
}

tab "Econ/SAM" {

    This tab displays a social accounting matrix (SAM) of the economy
    in spreadsheet form. The diagram below shows this tab when Athena
    is in <<term prep>> mode.<p>

    <<image econ_sam>><p>

    <b>SAM Inputs</b><p>

    This area shows the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM), sector 
    by sector, and related inputs and outputs. The SAM is displayed in
    two forms: the presumed size given the number of consumers and the
    resultant shape. The former is displayed a the top of the tab and
    contains monetary values, the latter at the bottom and contains the
    coefficients and rates that are used in the Econ model's Computable
    Equilibrium Model (CGE) matrix.<p>

    Cells that are a light green color are editable and it is these cells
    that the analyst should use when defining the money flows between 
    the sectors of the economy. Each time a cell is updated the shape
    parameters are automatically recomputed and displayed.<p>

    The grey cells in the upper matrix are computed from the green cells. Base
    revenues and base expenditures are computed from the rows and columns of 
    the matrix respectively and then, given base prices in the goods, 
    black and population sectors, base quantities (or more precisely, base 
    demand) is computed.<p>

    For the goods sector, a goods basket (goodsBKT) is the unit of measurement.
    A goods basket is a notional set of goods that the population
    buys and its associated price (defaulted to 1 USD per basket).
    For the black sector, a black basket (blackBKT) is the unit of measurement
    and the demand is the revenue divided by the price per blackBKT.
    A black basket is a notional set of black market products that
    the population buys. It can consist of any set of illicit items such as
    weapons or drugs.
    For the population sector, base demand is labor output of the workforce
    in work-years given the average annual income of a typical person in
    the area of interest.<p>

    <b>Other Inputs</b><p>

    This section allows the user to supply, in order,
    the black market feedstock price in dollars per year,
    the feedstock per unit of black market product (for example, if it takes 
    1.05 tons of poppies to make 1 ton of opium, then this value would be 
    1.05), the maximum amount of black market feedstock available, the 
    production capacity of the black market, the number of consumers, the 
    base case unemployment rate, the number of subsisters that the data 
    in the SAM is based upon and the subsistence farmer wage, which can 
    be approximated as whatever the poverty level is for the scenario.  
    The subsistence wage is used to compute the contribution of subsistence
    agriculture to the GDP. Following the subsistence agriculture figures
    is the amount of remittances being sent from overseas to the 
    population along with an annual percentage rate of change to that
    figure. This percentage can be positive, negative or zero. Note
    that if remittances are non-zero, the analyst must inlude how they are
    spent in the SAM inputs section. Otherwise, they do not contribute
    to GDP.<p>

    When Athena is locked, all the cells on the SAM remain visible, but are
    no longer editable unless the user returns to the <<term prep>> state.
    The diagram below shows this tab when Athena is <<term lock>>ed.<p>

    <<image econ_sam_locked>><p>

    After lock, there are three views of the SAM data available: the input
    flows, the balancing flows and the Base SAM.<p>

    The input flows are those that were provided by the analyst either through
    direct input into the matrix or, in the case of the actors sector, by
    the actor and strategy definitions.<p>

    The balancing flows (or T-matrix as it is referenced in the Economic 
    Model paper included with Athena) consists of values computed from other
    inputs. These are as follows:<p>

    <ul>
      <li>T.actors.black - Actors revenue from black market profits (if any).
      <li>T.world.black  - Total cost of feedstock for black market product.
      <li>T.world.goods  - Aggregate savings in the goods sector (can be negative)
      <li>T.pop.goods    - Aggregate savings in the pop sector (can be negative)
      <li>T.actors.world - Actors revenue due to graft on foreign aid
      <li>T.region.world - Reduction in revenue due to actors graft on aid
    </ul><p>

    Where the <i>T.i.j</i> simply indicate that it is the T-matrix and for
    which sectors the money flows.<p>

    The Base SAM is the sum of the input flows and the balancing flows. 
    These values are the ones used to initialize the CGE.<p>

    The SAM outputs are divided up into three sections: <b>Size Outputs</b>,
    <b>Exports/Foreign Aid Outputs</b> and <b>Misc. Outputs</b>.<p>

    <b>Size Outputs</b><p>

    This section contains values that aid the analyst in 
    determining the overall size of the economy given the inputs provided.
    These outputs include the base value for GDP,
    the per capita demand for goods and the 
    base contribution to GDP that subsistence agriculture makes.<p>

    <b>Exports/Foreign Aid Outputs</b><p>

    This section contains values from the
    SAM that have special meaning. Aid to Actors corresponds to the SAM's
    BX.actors.world cell. Likewise, Aid to Region is the same as the 
    BX.region.world cell. Exports are computed from the money flow to the
    goods, black and pop sectors from the world sector and the base price
    in each of those sectors that have product.<p>

    <b>Misc. Outputs</b><p>

    This section contains two outputs related to the black market: 
    the black market profit, which is the difference between Base Revenue and
    Base Expenditures in the black sector, and the cost of feedstock
    in dollars per year, which is computed by multiplying the base demand
    of black market product, the price of black market feedstock and the 
    feedstock required for one unit of product. <b>Note:</b> it is required
    that base revenue be higher than expenditures in the black sector.<p>

    <b>Shape Parameters</b><p>

    Lastly, the shape parameters appear in a matrix tableau.  These values
    are computed from the base size of the economy and are used to calibrate
    the actual economy when the scenario is locked and to compute the
    current state of the actual economy as Athena is run forward.<p>

    <b>Note:</b> The definition of actors and where they get their income, 
    along with their strategies and Athena parameters that define how actors
    spend their income will result in the actors sector money flows being
    computed when Athena is locked. 
}

tab "Econ/Overview" {
    <b>Simulation Mode only.</b><p>

    This tab displays the current state of the economy in two ways: in the
    "Dollars" matrix, as flows of money between the sectors of the economy and
    in the "Quantities" matrix as flows of product between the applicable 
    sectors of the economy. The actors, region and world sectors either do
    not have product (actors) or do not produce a product that matters to
    the local economy (region and world).<p>

    There are multiple views of the economy available which can be selected
    in the "Views:" dropdown menu at the upper right.  By default, the fully
    constrained economy is shown.  This view reflects any labor and goods
    constraints, the effects of people living to far away from where the
    jobs are (geographic unemployment) and the effects of security on the 
    population's willingness to go to work or go out shopping.  The other 
    views available are a capacity constrained view, which reflects the 
    effects of only labor and goods capacity and geographic unemployment,
    ignoring the effects of security, an unconstrained view
    which ignores any capacity constraints and assumes everyone that can work
    is working (except for the "between jobs" turbulence) and, lastly, a view
    of the values calibrated by Athena from the Base SAM.  The calibrated 
    values of GDP and unemployment rate should reflect those in the base case
    SAM.<p>

    Below the "Dollars" and "Quantities" matrices are inputs to the economy
    that contribute to the size of it and the most salient outputs.<p>

    <<image econ_current>><p>

    The size of the economy is driven by the
    number of consumers, the size of the labor force, the wage index of
    labor and the price index of goods.  The Consumer 
    Security Factor (or CSF) is the fraction of the consumers that are 
    willing to go out and buy things and the Labor Security Factor, 
    or LSF, is the fraction of workers who are actually willing 
    to go to work under current security conditions. The graft factor as
    computed by how much money the actors are receiving from skimming off
    foreign aid to the region appears next. Increasing the amount of 
    income from graft in the actor definitions will increase this factor.
    Lastly, the amount of remittances including any increase or decrease
    due to an annual percentage rate appears.<p>

    The most salient outputs consist of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
    the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Deflated GDP, the per capita 
    Deflated GDP, the average per capita demand for goods, the number of 
    unemployed workers in the playbox along 
    with the unemployment rate.  Real Unemployment includes those that
    are geographically unemployed, but not those "between jobs". 
    The amount of the labor force afraid to 
    go to work due to lack of neighborhood security is the Insecure Labor
    Force. This number is part of Unemployment, but not part of Real
    Unemployment.<p>

# Scripts

tab "Scripts" {
    <b>This tab can be made visible by selecting the
    <<menu "View/Scripts Editor">> menu item.</b><p>

    <b>Background</b><p>

    Athena's <<term executive>>
    can execute individual <<cref /command commands>>, and also longer
    scripts of commands.  It is exposed by the <<term cli>>, and is also
    used by the <<cref /object/tactic/executive>> and the
    <<cref /object/condition/expr>>.
    The scripts are written in the TCL programming
    language; see the <i>Athena User's Guide</i> for a brief introduction.<p>

    Prior to Athena 5, it was usual to use the 
    <<cref /object/tactic/executive>> by writing executive scripts as
    ".tcl" files in the host file system.  The tactic would then execute
    an executive command like this one:<p>

    <pre>
        call myscript.tcl
    </pre>

    This was effective but troublesome, as the .tcl scripts needed to be
    kept with the scenario's .adb file, and edited in a different 
    application.<p>

    Athena 5 adds the ability to store executive scripts within the
    scenario itself, and edit them within the Athena application.  These
    scripts can be called exactly like external script files, and can also be
    executed automatically.  Auto-executed scripts will often define Tcl
    procedures (see <<command proc>>) for use by the
    <<cref /object/tactic/executive>> and <<cref /object/condition/expr>>.<p>

    <b>User Interface</b>

    The Script Editor's user interface is divided into three areas: the
    Script List, the Editor proper, and the Output area.<p>

    The Script List contains a list of the names of the currently defined
    scripts.  To create a new script, press the <<image button_plus>>
    or <<image button_import>> buttons.  To edit or browse a particular
    script, select it in the list.  To make the selected script auto-executing, 
    press the <<image button_power>> button.<p>

    The body of the selected script is shown in the Editor, to the
    right of the script list.  This is a normal text editor, with 
    syntax-highlighting.  To save an edited script, press the "Save"
    button.  <b>NOTE:</b> Pressing "Save" saves your edits into the
    scenario, i.e., the edited script will now be saved with the rest of the
    scenario.  The scenario itself must still be saved in the usual way.<p>

    There are many controls; read the following table carefully.<p>

    <<topiclist Control Description>>
    <<topic [image button_plus]>>
    Create a new script.  Athena will prompt you for the script's name, and
    will add the script to the script list.  Edit the script's body in the
    Editor.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_import]>>
    Imports a script from the disk into the scenario.  Athena will prompt
    you to select a ".tcl" file from the disk; the new stored script's
    name will be the name of the disk file minus the ".tcl" extension.
    If a script of that name already exists, Athena will add a suffix 
    (e.g., "-1") to the name.<p>

    <b>NOTE:</b> Most existing script files are designed to be 
    used with the <<command call>> command, and do their work as soon as
    they are loaded; i.e., a script file designed for use with the
    <<cref /object/tactic/executive>> expects to be called only by
    the tactic.  Stored scripts are expected to define Tcl procedures
    using the <<command proc>> command; these procedures can then be
    used by the <<cref /object/tactic/executive>> tactic.  Thus, most
    imported scripts will probably require some editing to be useful.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_export]>>
    Prompts the user to save the selected script as a disk file.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_power]>>
    Toggles the selected script's auto-execute flag.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_totop]>>
    Moves the selected script to the top of the list; it will be executed
    first on executive <<command reset>>.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_raise]>>
    Moves the selected script one spot up in the execution sequence;
    it will be executed earlier on executive <<command reset>>.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_lower]>>
    Moves the selected script one slot down in the execution sequence;
    it will be executed later on executive <<command reset>>.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_tobottom]>>
    Moves the selected script to the end of the list; it will be
    executed last on executive <<command reset>>.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_trash]>>
    Deletes the selected script.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic "Rename">>
    Prompts the user to enter a new name for the selected script.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic "Revert">>
    Throws away any unsaved edits for the selected
    script.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic "Reset">>
    Resets the executive, which loads all of the auto-executing scripts.
    The status of each is displayed in the Output area; the effect is the
    same as entering the <<command reset>> in the <<term cli>>.<p>

    This is a useful last step after editing a script, as it leaves the
    executive in a clean state.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic "Check">>
    Checks the script in the Editor for obvious errors, which it displays
    in the Output area.  Click on an error message in the Output area
    to jump to the matching line of code.<p>

    The checker cannot find all errors.  It will not find unknown variables,
    for example.  Also, if you have a script that defines and uses procs,
    those procs will show up as undefined if the script has not been
    successfully executed.<p>
    <</topic>>

    <<topic "Execute">>
    Executes the script in the Editor, showing the results in the 
    Output area.  If there are unsaved changes, they remain unsaved.
    <p>

    <b>Note:</b> Programming is tricky.  Executing the script will
    define any Tcl procedures included within it; but it does not
    verify that those procedures are error-free or will do what the
    user wants.  Always test scripts carefully!
    <</topic>>

    <<topic "Save">>
    Saves the script into the scenario, so that it will be saved to disk 
    with the rest of the scenario.
    If the script's auto-execute flag is set, it will also execute the command, showing the results in the Output area.

# Log

tab "Log" {
    <b>This tab can be made visible by selecting the
    <<menu "View/Scrolling Log">> menu item.</b><p>

    As Athena runs, it produces a detailed log of its operation.  This
    log is primarily intended for aid in debugging, but it can
    sometimes be useful to the user as well.  The Log tab gives access
    to this debugging log.<p>

    The log browser contains the following elements:<p>

    <ul>
    <li> At the top, a tool bar containing the 
         <<seebelow controls "browser controls">>.
    <li> On the left, a 
         <<seebelow loglist "list of the log files">>
         created during this session.
    <li> On the right, the 
         <<seebelow contents "contents">>
         of the currently-selected log.
    </ul><p>

    <b><a name="contents">Log Contents:</a></b>  A log file contains a
    sequence of log entries.  Each log entry begins with the 
    <<term jweek>> string at which it was logged.  This is followed by the 
    <<term loglevel>>, and then by the name of the application module
    that wrote the entry to the log, e.g., <b>sim</b>.  Finally comes
    the log text proper, which might wrap onto multiple lines if
    appropriate.<p>

    <b><a name="loglist">Log List:</a></b> As Athena runs it produces
    a series of log files; the log list lists these files in the order
    of creation.  By default the most recent file is selected; click
    on any file in the list to browse its contents.<p>

    Athena opens a new log file whenever any of the following events
    occur:<p>

    <ul>
    <li> At start-up (<b>start</b>)
    <li> When a new scenario is created (<b>new</b>)
    <li> When an existing scenario is opened (<b>open</b>)
    <li> When saving the scenario under a new name (<b>saveas</b>)
    <li> When entering <<term snapshot>> mode (<b>snapshot</b>)
    <li> When leaving snapshot mode and re-entering the 
         <<term prep>> state. (<b>prep</b>)
    <li> When leaving snapshot mode and re-entering the paused
         state. (<b>latest</b>) 
    <li> When the current log file grows too large.
    </ul><p>

    The log file name contains a serial number, starting at 
    00001, and a suffix that indicates why the new log file was
    opened; the suffixes are shown in parenthesis, above.  If the new
    log file was created because the previous file was too large, the
    new file's name will have no suffix.<p>

    <b><a name="controls">Browser Controls:</a></b>  The browser's
    toolbar contains the following controls:<p>

    <<topiclist Control Description>>
    <<topic [image control_loglevel]>>
    <b><<term loglevel Log-Level>></b>.  This control determines the
    severity of the log entries that are displayed.  By default,
    entries of severity <b>normal</b> and above are displayed, and
    entries with severity of <b>detail</b> and <b>debug</b> are
    not.<p>

    The most common use of this control is to select <b>detail</b>
    from the pulldown so that detailed log entries are displayed.
    <</topic>>

    <<control.filterbox>>

    <<topic [image control_logtar]>> <b>Search Text.</b>  The
    next control allows the user to enter a search text string.  The
    browser will highlight all entries in the current log file that
    match the search text.<p>

    By default, the browser looks for an exact match of the text;
    click on the magnifying glass icon to pop up a menu of other
    options.<p>

    Click on the "circle-x" icon to delete the search text and remove
    the highlighting from the log entries.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_logsrch]>> <b>Search Back
    Controls.</b>  By default, the browser searches for the search
    text only in the current log file.  Use these controls to search
    back through the list of log files (the upward-pointing triangles)
    and back down again (the downward-pointing triangles).  Press the
    stop button (the black square) if searching is taking too long.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_logcnt]>> <b>Found Entry Count.</b>
    When the user enters search text, the browser shows the number of
    found entries, as well as the index of the currently displayed
    entry.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image control_logvcr]>> <b>VCR Controls.</b>
    Use these controls to navigate to the entries containing the
    search text in the current log file.
    <</topic>>

    <<topic [image button_lock]>>
    <b>Auto-Scroll</b>.  Normally, the log browser automatically
    jumps to the latest log entry as new entries are written.
    Toggle this button to prevent the browser from jumping to the
    latest log entry while you are looking at something else.
    Untoggle the button to restore the usual behavior.
