mars_gram(1) Modules
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the app_gram(n) package, which contains
the modules of Tcl code specific to the GRAM Workbench executable,
mars_gram(1).  


NOTE: Because the modules in this package represent 
application-level code, they are generally defined as singletons
and live in the global namespace.
