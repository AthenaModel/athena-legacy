The following files implement customizations to NaturalDocs for
use in Mars and dependent projects:

* Languages.txt
* Topics.txt
* MyCss.css

To use the Mars customizations in another Tcl/Snit-based project,
create an ndproj directory in the project, and copy these files
to it.  Then, use it the ndproj directory as the "-p" directory
on the NaturalDocs command line.  See mars/docs/Makefile for
details on how to call NaturalDocs.
