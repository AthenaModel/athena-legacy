<h2>Build Notes</h2>

<h3>Build 2.12, 31 October 2012</h3>

This build removes the obsolete module timeline(n), and the related
dependency on the Plotchart package.<p>

<h3>Build 2.11, 29 October 2012</h3>

This build contains changes required to move Athena from using
Zulu-time strings to Julian week strings as its human-readable time
format.  In addition, the underlying Tcl infrastructure was updated to
the 2012Q3 build of ActiveTcl Enterprise Edition, and code was added
to make it possible to use geo-registered maps in Athena.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 3729: geotiff(n): geotiff reader for Mars
<li> Bug 3731: geotiff(n): geotiff reader should give proper error message if file is not found
<li> Bug 3735: geotiff(n): read GEOGRAPHIC model type from GeoTIFF file.
<li> Bug 3743: simclock(i) interface
<li> Bug 3753: Remove gram2(n) and related software
<li> Bug 3754: Set MARS_TCL_HOME in MakePlatform
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 2.10, 3 October 2012</h3>

This build contains performance improvements to URAM and to Mars'
SQLite3 infrastructure.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 3723: uram(n): Optimizations
<li> Bug 3726: sqlib(n): grab/ungrab
</ul><p>


<h3>Build 2.9, 26 September 2012</h3>

This build contains a performance optimization to the marsutil(n)
report handling code, and an enhancement to sqldocument(n) to aid
performance optimization of SQL queries.  The full set of packages is
as follows:<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 3710: sqldocument(n): explain, -explaincmd
<li> Bug 3713: reporter(n)/reportbrowser(n) optimization
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 2.8, 24 September 2012</h3>

This build contains minor fixes to dynabox(n) and cellmodel(n).<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 3689: dynabox(n): Error flags not cleared when all fields contain valid data.
<li> Bug 3703: cellmodel(n): pageinfo cyclic and pageinfo order fail if model is not sane.
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 2.7, 11 September 2012</h3>

The build contains some minor bug fixes and some cellmodel(n) changes
in support of the new athena_cell(1) tool.<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 3649: mars_cmtool(1): Error when called with no arguments
<li> Bug 3653: isearch(n): Ctrl-S for searching conflicts with Ctrl-S for saving documents
<li> Bug 3654: cellmodel(n): Improved reporting of syntax errors in cellmodel(5) input
<li> Bug 3657: cellmodel(n): Instrument cellmodel(5) commands with line numbers
<li> Bug 3661: order(n): prepare -num
<li> Bug 3663: moneyscan: leading zeroes treated as octal
<li> Bug 3670: cellmodel(n): [cellinfo uses] can miss some cells
<li> Bug 3675: dynaform(n): contextkey field type.
</ul><p>


<h3>Build 2.6, 21 August 2012</h3>

This build contains two changes to the cellmodel(5) tools in support
of debugging Athena's 6x6 CGE.<p>

<ul>
    <li> Bug 3637: cellmodel(n): add a -failcmd option that calls back to users with some information about a failure
    <li> Bug 3638: mars_cmtool(1): add -initfrom option to allow cell models to be initialized from outside data
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 2.5, 13 August 2012</h3>

This build contains bug fixes and some improvements to marsgui(n)'s
ability to display  monetary spreadsheet data.<p>

<ul>
    <li> Bug 3616: htmlviewer(n): "submit" elements have visible border
    <li> Bug 3620: dynabox(n): Dynaform-based modal dialog
    <li> Bug 3621: marsmisc(n): commafmt command should use wide() not int()
    <li> Bug 3623: marsmisc(n): add option to commafmt command to specify decimal places
    <li> Bug 3624: cmsheet(n): add -browsecommand option
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 2.4, 2 August 2012</h3>

This build contains two additions to marsutil(n)'s order(n) module's
[prepare] command, the -oneof and -someof options.  These allow 
[prepare] to validate that a particular parameter's value is within
a set of values, or is a subset of a set of values, where the set of
values is specified as a list rather than as the name of a validation
type.<p>

<ul>
    <li> Bug 3607: order(n): prepare -oneof, -someof
</ul><p>


<h3>Build 2.3, 25 July 2012</h3>

This build integrates the dynaform(n)/dynaview(n) data entry form
infrastructure into Mars and specifically into
order(n)/orderdialog(n).  In addition, order(n)/orderdialog(n) are no
longer integrated with the eventq(n) mechanism; orders can no longer
be scheduled in advance.  (We've learned that that's the wrong
abstraction; orders are about user input right now.  Scheduling
applies to other entities.)<p>

In addition, there are significant updates to the cmsheet(n) module,
allowing much improved user input via a cmsheet(n).<p>

The complete set of changes is as follows:<p>

<ul>
    <li> Bug 3591: dynaform(n)/dynaview(n)
    <li> Bug 3594: dynaform(n)/order(n): Improved validation of selector cases
    <li> Bug 3595: cmsheet(n): change behavior and add -changecmd option
    <li> Bug 3598: dynaform(n) test suite
</ul><p>


<h3>Build 2.2, 2 July 2012</h3>

This build is in support of the Athena 4.0.8 Engineering Release to
TRISA. It contains the following minor change:<p>

<ul>
<li> Bug 3580: htmlviewer(n): INPUT elements should have border: 1px.
</ul>

<h3>Build 2.1, 25 June 2012</h3>

This build contains the following changes:<p>

<ul>
    <li> Bug 3557: sqlbrowser(n): disable column-label sorting
    <li> Bug 3565: Remove TkHTML 2.0 and related software
    <li> Bug 3566: Move htmllviewer3(n) from projectgui(n) to marsgui(n) as htmlviewer(n).
    <li> Bug 3569: Update CM plan to Mars 2.0
</ul><p>

<h3>Build 2.0, 21 June 2012</h3>

Build 2.0 is the first Mars 2.x build; Mars has been split, with Mars
1.x continuing to support JNEM maintenance and Mars 2.x supporting
Athena 4.0.x development.  This will allow the TkHTML 2.0 widget
currently used in Mars to be replaced by the TkHTML 3.0 widget now
used in Athena.<p>

Build 2.0 contains no changes except for those required to identify it
as Mars 2.x.  In terms of the Mars code, it is identical to Mars
1.70.<p>
